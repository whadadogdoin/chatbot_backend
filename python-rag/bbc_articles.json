    "content": "Israel's military has announced the launch of a major offensive aimed at defeating Hamas and securing the freedom of remaining hostages in Gaza.The Israeli Defense Forces said on its Hebrew X account that it had mobilised troops for \"Operation Gideon's Chariots\" to seize \"strategic areas\" of the strip.Hamas-run civil defence and health ministry officials say Israeli attacks have killed around 250 people since Thursday.Israel imposed an aid blockade on the strip in March after the breakdown of a two-month ceasefire. Donald Trump, the US president, said on Friday that \"a lot of people were starving\" in Gaza.\nThe Israeli military did not use the operational name in similar posts on its English-language X account.It said it would not stop operating \"until Hamas is no longer a threat and all our hostages are home\", and had \"struck over 150 terror targets throughout the Gaza Strip\" in 24 hours.Israel has intensified its bombardment and built up armoured forces along the border despite growing international pressure to resume ceasefire talks and end its blockade. The launch of the operation appears to suggest all efforts have failed.The Times of Israel said that \"Gideon's Chariots\" - a reference to a biblical warrior - would see the IDF take and control territory, move civilians to the south of the strip, attack Hamas and prevent it from taking control of aid supplies.Jeremy Bowen: Netanyahu's plan risks dividing Israel, killing Palestinians and horrifying worldRos Atkins: How world leaders are responding to Israel's blockadeBenjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, earlier this month said that Israel was preparing an \"intense entry into Gaza\" to capture and hold territory.His government said that it would not commence until Trump had completed a tour of the Middle East. The US president left the region on Friday.\nUN Human Rights Chief Volker TÃ¼rk has warned that Israel's recent escalation could be considered a breach of international law.\"This latest barrage of bombs, forcing people to move amid the threat of intensified attacks, the methodical destruction of entire neighbourhoods, and the denial of humanitarian assistance underline that there appears to be a push for a permanent demographic shift in Gaza that is in defiance of international law and is tantamount to ethnic cleansing,\" he said.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US was \"troubled\" by the situation.Victoria Rose, a British reconstructive surgeon working at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that her team were \"exhausted\" and had all lost a \"considerable amount of weight\".\"The children are really thin,\" she said. \"We've got a lot of youngsters whose teeth have fallen out.\"\"A lot of them have quite significant burn injuries and with this level of malnutrition they're so much more prone to infection and they've got so much less capacity to heal.\"A UN-backed assessment published on Monday found Gaza's population to be at \"critical risk\" of famine.The Israeli government has repeatedly rejected claims there is a food shortage in Gaza.Israel launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Hamas still holds 57."

    "content": "Nine people have been killed in a Russian drone attack on a civilian minibus in north-eastern Ukraine, local officials say.Regional military leaders said seven other people were injured in the attack on Saturday morning in Bilopillia, Sumy, as the minibus travelled to the regional capital close to Russia's border.The report came just hours after Russia and Ukraine held their first direct peace talks since 2022. No breakthrough was achieved, although a prisoner of war swap was agreed.Volodymr Zelensky, Ukraine's president, said the attack was \"a deliberate killing of civilians\". Russia has not commented directly but state media reported forces had hit a \"military staging area\" in Sumy.\nZelensky added that Russian forces \"could not help but understand what kind of vehicle they were hitting\".Citing preliminary information, Sumy regional head Oleh Hryhorov said the bus was hit by a Russian Lancet drone at 06:17 local time on Saturday (03:17 GMT). He described the attack as \"inhumane\".Friday's talks in Istanbul, Turkey, did not lead to any breakthrough as Ukraine and Russia remain far apart on how to end the war.However, it was agreed that each side would return 1,000 prisoners of war to the other in the coming days.Zelensky said of the talks that \"as on any day of this war, there was an opportunity to cease fire. Ukraine has been offering this for a long time.\"\nFollowing the Istanbul discussions, Ukraine reiterated its call for a full and unconditional ceasefire but a deal with Russia remained elusive.Ukraine said the next step in the process would be direct talks between Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky and Russia's Vladimir Putin.Russia said it had \"taken notice\" of the request.The US has claimed that progress on ending the war would only be made if President Donald Trump and Putin held face-to-face talks.During a visit to the Middle East, Trump told reporters on Air Force One \"nothing's going to happen until Putin and I get together\".\"He wasn't going if I wasn't there and I don't believe anything's going to happen, whether you like it or not, until he and I get together,\" Trump added.Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Ukraine used Sumy to launch offensives into Russia's Kursk region in August. Russia drove the majority of Ukraine's troops back earlier this year and has intensified cross-border artillery and air attacks in recent months.Earlier this week before talks began with Ukraine, Russia carried out drone strikes across the region, killing three people and injuring nine others, according to Sumy's regional military administration.On Saturday, Ukrainian drones reportedly struck an ammunition depot in Crimea, the region illegally annexed by Russia in 2014.According to Reuters, Ukraine's strike caused the detonation of warehouses where military equipment, weapons and fuel was stored."

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce82vdgene7o",
    "content": "Ten prisoners, several of them facing murder charges, have escaped from a New Orleans jail and may have had help from staff inside the facility, authorities say.The inmates are thought to have fled around midnight, and were discovered missing during a headcount at 08:30 local time (13:30 GMT) at the Orleans Parish Jail on Friday morning. One of the 10 has been recaptured.\"There's no way for anyone to get out of this facility without help,\" Sheriff Susan Huston said during a news conference.The sheriff's office posted photos showing how the inmates escaped, which included taunting messages apparently left by the escapees. \"To Easy LoL,\" one message read.\nOne inmate was apprehended in New Orleans' French Quarter, police said. The other nine are considered \"armed and dangerous\", the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office said, adding that a manhunt was continuing.Louisiana State Police identified one escapee as Kendall Myles in central New Orleans through facial recognition technology after he was filmed on a surveillance camera.He tried to flee on foot before being apprehended hiding underneath a car in a parking garage, police said.He was transported back to the Orleans Parish Jail, and \"is being rebooked at the facility for a new charge of Simple Escape\", it said in a statement.The New Orleans Police Department has released the names and photographs of the other escapeesin a post on X.The Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office initially said 11 prisoners had escaped from the facility, but the number was revised to 10 later on Friday.Sheriff Hutson said the inmates yanked the sliding door from their jail cell off its tracks at 00:23 in the early hours of Friday morning (05:23 GMT).They exited the jail about half an hour later after ripping a toilet from the wall and breaking metal bars around a hole in the wall that was used for piping.They then climbed down a wall and ran across a highway, the sheriff said.The sheriff's office released images of the hole in the wall, which shows what thepiping fixture looked like before the toilet was rippedout. The photos note that \"there are clean cuts\" on themetal bars, which facilitated their escape.The photos also show messages on the wall apparently left behind by the inmates.\nThe photos show messages scrawled in pen, including \"To Easy LoL\" with an arrow pointing to the hole. It also shows a smiley face with its tongue out and another message, partially smudged, that appears to tell officers to catch the inmates when they can.New Orleans police chief Anne Kirkpatrick said the prisoner escape was an \"urgent and serious situation\" and encouraged the public to report any suspicious activity.Victims of some of the escapees have been notified, she said, adding that several are facing murder and other violent charges.The inmates probably had help, Supt Kirkpatrick said, and are unlikely to still be wearing prison uniforms, warning that anyone who helped the inmates would be charged.The FBI and US Marshals have also joined local police in the search, she added.The Orleans Parish Jail is located near the centre of the city, around 3 km (2 miles) from the city's famous French Quarter."

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ge0xk4ld1o",
    "content": "The US has lost its last perfect credit rating, as influential ratings firm Moody's expressed concern over the government's ability to pay back its debt.In lowering the US rating from 'AAA' to 'Aa1', Moody's noted that successive US administrations had failed to reverse ballooning deficits and interest costs.A triple-A rating signifies a country's highest possible credit reliability, and indicates it is considered to be in very good financial health with a strong capacity to repay its debts.Moody's warned in 2023 the US triple-A rating was at risk. Fitch Ratings downgraded the US in 2023 and S&P Global Ratings did so in 2011. Moody's held a perfect credit rating for the US since 1917.\nThe downgrade \"reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,\" Moody's said in the statement.In a statement, the White House said it was \"focused on fixing Biden's mess\", while taking a swipe at Moody's.\"If Moody's had any credibility,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said, \"they would not have stayed silent as the fiscal disaster of the past four years unfolded.\"A lower credit rating means countries are more likely to default on their sovereign debt, and generally face higher borrowing costs.Moody's maintained that the US \"retains exceptional credit strengths such as size, resilience and dynamism and the continued role of the US dollar as the global reserve currency\".The firm said it expects federal debt to increase to around 134% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035, up from 98% last year.GDP is a measure of all the economic activity of companies, governments, and people in a country.The BBC has reached out to the US Department of Treasury for comment.The downgrade came on the same day asTrump's landmark spending billsuffered a setback in Congress.Trump's so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" failed to pass the House Budget Committee, with some Republicans voting against it.Figures showed theUS economy shrank in the first three months of the yearas government spending fell and imports surged due to firms racing to get goods into the country ahead of tariffs.The economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3%, a sharp downturn after growth of 2.4% in the previous quarter, the Commerce Department said."

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj42nvrkgzno",
    "content": "Cassie Ventura has tearfully told a court she would give back a $20m (Â£15m) legal settlement from Sean \"Diddy\" Combs if it meant she would never have taken part in his \"humiliating\" drug-fuelled sex parties.She rejected defence suggestions that her accusations were financially motivated as she wrapped up four days of testimony in the New York criminal trial of her ex-boyfriend.Ms Ventura, the government's star witness, faced questioning from both legal teams about her decade-long relationship with Mr Combs, and their \"freak off\" sex sessions.Mr Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. He could face life in prison.\nMs Ventura's testimony revealed graphic details about her sex life with the rapper and the physical violence she allegedly endured from him.The rap mogul's lawyers have been trying to depict Ms Ventura, 38, as an eager participant in the sexual lifestyle.She testified this week that she was coerced into the sessions, which involved male escorts, because Mr Combs had threatened her with violence.On Friday she addressed a $20m pay-out he gave her after she filed a lawsuit against him in November 2023.The settlement, which came just one day after the filing of the legal action, was public knowledge, but the number was previously unknown.Mr Combs' lawyer, Anna Estevao, seemed to imply that Ms Ventura was strapped for cash before filing her lawsuit. The singer had just moved to her parents' house with her husband and children.Ms Ventura rejected this suggestion, later sharing that she would exchange the money for a life free of the \"freak offs\", which she said caused her physical injuries, would sometimes go on for days, and stifled her career as a singer.\"I would have agency and autonomy,\" she said.\nMr Combs' legal team also showed the jury dozens of messages between the couple from each stage of their relationship, arguing their dynamic was toxic at times, but not criminal.Minutes before Ms Ventura was set to leave the stand on Friday, the defence questioned her about another legal settlement she won.Ms Ventura told the court she was expecting to receive about $10m from InterContinental Hotels, connected to her claims against Mr Combs.The settlement relates to an incident at the InterContinental in Los Angeles in 2016, in which security footage showed Mr Combs hitting, kicking and dragging her in a hallway.That clip was played at length in court this week, and is one of the most important pieces of evidence in the trial.On Friday in court, Ms Ventura went through her texts after that beating. In one message she told Mr Combs: \"I'm not a rag doll. I'm somebody's child.\"She and Mr Combs were expressing love for each other days later in other texts.The defence cross-examination continued on all day Thursday and Friday.The prosecution squeezed in two more witnesses before court adjourned for the weekend.One was Dawn Richard, a singer in the group Danity Kane - formed on Diddy's MTV show Making the Band. Last year she filed a lawsuit accusing him of physical abuse and withholding her earnings.Ms Richard testified that she saw Mr Combs assault Ms Ventura at his Los Angeles mansion in 2009.\"She fell down,\" Ms Richard told the court. \"She was in the foetal position.\"After the incident, she said Mr Combs took her aside and told her what she saw was \"passion\" and that where he is from, \"people go missing\" if they talk.US Homeland Security special agent Yasin Binda took the stand as well, telling the court about the cash, drugs and baby oil that were seized from the rapper's hotel room when he was arrested in New York.More testimony is expected from the witnesses called by prosecutors next week.The Manhattan court has been a media circus since the beginning of the trial, with spectators gathering in droves and camping out overnight to get a glimpse of the music mogul, his family, and the celebrities testifying."

    "content": "\"Melania\" appeared on the banks of the River Sava in July 2020, four months before her human inspiration left the White House.Now, four months after the erstwhile Melanija Knavs resumed residence at Washington's most famous address, her larger-than-life-size avatar has apparently made an undignified exit from her Slovenian hometown, Sevnica.All that remains of the massive bronze statue are the feet â and the two-metre-tall tree stump they were standing on.\nMelania Trump sculpture in Slovenia set on fire on US Independence DayNew Melania Trump metal statue unveiled in Slovenia\nThe symmetry would probably appeal to the whimsical US director Wes Anderson â who often features bizarre heists in his films. But even in his back catalogue, there has never been anything quite like the case of the cursed First Lady statue.Because this is not the first time a Melania Trump tribute has met a sticky end in Sevnica.The first iteration was unveiled in July 2019. Carved from a single piece of wood by a chainsaw-wielding local artisan called Ales \"Maxi\" Zupevc, it lasted a year before an unidentified perpetrator decided to turn it into a Fourth of July bonfire.Luckily, US artist Brad Downey â who commissioned Maxi to create the wooden original â had already made a cast of the statue. It duly made a comeback in bronze, at the same site.At its unveiling, Mr Downey said the new version had been designed to be \"as solid as possible, out of a durable material which cannot be wantonly destroyed\".But, as it turns out, it can be chopped off at the ankles and taken away.Local police say they are treating \"Melania's\" disappearance as \"theft\" and have launched an investigation.\nBrad Downey has always insisted that his work was political. He chose Maxi as a collaborator because his upbringing had been similar to that of the First Lady.And he argued that Melania Trump benefitted from a fast-tracked US citizenship process, while other immigrants suffered under her husband's \"xenophobic\" policies.Now he suspects the statue's disappearance \"has something to do with Trump getting re-elected\".Meanwhile, in Sevnica, the local authorities have mixed feelings. They condemned \"any form of interference with private or public property\".But, they added, \"the image of the US First Lady was not something anyone was proud of\"."

    "content": "The Eurovision Song Contest reaches its grand final on Saturday night in Basel, with 26 countries fighting for the coveted glass microphone trophy.The competition feels less predictable than recent years, when acts like Loreen (Sweden, 2023) and Kalush Orchestra (Ukraine, 2022) were ordained to win before they'd even sung a note.Currently, bookmakers have installed Sweden at the top of the table, with their delightfully bonkers sauna sonnet, Bara Bada Bastu.But here's the thing: A novelty number has never won. Voters typically prefer songs about triumph over adversity, and stonking great pop anthems.Ideally, they want a stonking great pop anthemabouttriumph over adversity, and there are plenty of those sprinkled through tonight's running order.We spoke to the five contestants with the best odds, to find out what makes their Eurovision entries stand out.\nChance of winning: 39%Language: SwedishGenre: EpadunkSpotify streams: 43.9mKAJ are the first Finnish act to represent Sweden at the Eurovision, hailing from the coastal town of VÃ¶rÃ¥, where Swedish is still the main language.A comedy troupe who met at school, they've been performing together for more than 15 years â and were the surprise winners of Sweden's Melodifestivalen, where the public selects the country's Eurovision entry, earlier this year.Their song, Bara Bada Bastu, is an accordian-led tribute to sauna culture (Finland has more than three million saunas, one for every two people).\"It felt like a natural thing to sing about,\" says Kevin HolmstrÃ¶m. \"We really like the sauna. It's universal.\"The first Swedish-language entry since 2012, the song extols the practice's stress-busting virtues. Is that why Finland is consistently ranked as the world's happiest nation, I wonder?\"It's a chicken and an egg situation,\" laughs Jakob NorrgÃ¥rd. \"I don't know which came first, the happiness or the sauna, but the sauna definitely brings your pulse down.\"The trio have brought a mock sauna to the Eurovision stage this year, complete with birch branches, hot coals and dancers in skimpy towels. In the lyrics, they ask, \"how long can you last?\".\"Oh, we can make it last all evening,\" confirms Jackob. \"A sauna party that lasts for hours.\"\"I like to do it with a lot of intervals,\" says Axel Ãhman. \"Two to three hours, going in and out, having something to drink, maybe even snack on a sausage outside, and then go back in â just to make it a calm and long session.\"And how does Finland feel about the fact the trio are representing their neighbour and Eurovision rival?\"Finns love a bargain, so this is great,\" laughs Jackob.\"Sweden gets to pay for everything, but it's a Finnish win as well.\"\nChance of winning: 22%Language: EnglishGenre: Pop-operaSpotify streams: 6mAustria has the best opening couplet of the year: \"I'm an ocean of love / And you're scared of water.\"\"It's about my personal experience with unreciprocated love,\" says singer Johannes Pietsch, who performs under the name JJ. \"It felt like I was walking a one-way street.\"The 24-year-old is moonlighting at Eurovision from his day job at the Vienna State Opera, where he's had roles in The Magic Flute and Von der Liebe Tod.\"A sold-out show at the opera holds 1,600 people, so that's nothing compared to the Eurovision audience,\" he says (last year's TV broadcast was seen by 163 million people).Pietsch's song, Wasted Love, is a turbulent ballad that makes spectacular use of his counter-tenor, with an EDM twist.On stage, he performs in a ramshackle sailing boat, clinging to the mast as the ocean threatens to consume him. It's one of the night's most arresting performances, and it requires a lot of preparation.\"That's the opera singer in me, I practice every day.\" he says. \"I have to do vocal warm-ups to keep the voice active and before I go on stage, I always do ten push-ups and one-minute planks.\"Reaching the Eurovision final has been a dream since he watched Conchita Wurst win for Austria in 2014. Could he replicate that success in Switzerland?\"That would be great for Austria. I would love to do that. I would call Conchita my mother, so I'd love to make her proud.\"\nChance of winning: 8%Language: FrenchGenre: Torch songSpotify streams: 6.9m\"I'm surrounded by a sand storm, a sand tornado, and I'll be wearing a custom Rabanne dress.\"French singer Louane is describing the simple, but stunning, staging for her ballad, Maman.The sand is real (how she avoids inhaling it, I'll never know) but it serves a purpose: The song, which was inspired by her mother's death from cancer, is all about the passage of time.\"It's a song that says that, even through sadness and deep pain, you can finally feel fine,\" she says.Maman is technically a sequel to a 2015 song of the same name, written in the depths of Louane's despair. \"I've lost my taste for fun / I can't find meaning,\" she sang.The 2025 version includes several callbacks to the first song. For example, the original opened with the lyric: \"Lovers move from bed to bed\", but the update finds her singing, \"No more lovers, no more beds.\"Having a child of her own helped Louane lift the veil of grief.In the song, she talks about how holding her daughter's hand brought back memories of the times her mum had done the same - only this time, the pain of remembering was gone.In Maman's closing bars, we briefly hear her daughter's voice.\"She won't be here in Basel,\" says Louane. \"She's going to be watching on TV, because she's only five.\"\"But she's super proud. She keeps on telling me, 'Maman, you have to bring the trophy home.\"She's just adorable'.\"\nChance of winning: 6%Language: French and EnglishGenre: ChansonSpotify streams: 17.2mThe Netherlands originally asked last year's entrant, Joost Klein â who was barred from the final after an alleged altercation with a camera operator â the chance to come back for 2025.Although he'd already written a song for the contest, he declined, saying his disqualification still \"stings\".Instead, the honour went to 21-year-old Claude Kiambe, who moved to the Netherlands from the Democratic Republic of Congo when he was nine years old.\"It wasn't always safe in Congo,\" he says. \"I couldn't afford to go to schoolâ¦ and I love school.\"His mum eventually managed to smuggle the family out of the country, and it's to her that his Eurovision song is dedicated.Titled C'est La Vie, it's a joyous blend of Afropop and French chanson that repeats the advice she used to give Claude and his siblings in the asylum centre in Alkmaar.\"She used to tell me, 'C'est la vie. Life is beautiful, even if it is hard sometimes.'\"So when I heard about Eurovision, I was like, 'Wait, if I go there, I want to bring that message to the world'.\"I have a lot of respect for her. She fought through life, and we're still here.\"Claude comes into the contest with a little advantage, as he's known throughout Europe for his massive 2022 hit Ladada. But he's had to pick up a new skill for Eurovision: Choreography.\"I'd only ever done one dance move before, but when I was writing the song, I was like, 'It's time for me to step out of my comfort zone and dance around'.\"Learning the choreography took three days, he reckons. \"We started at 11 and ended at nine. I wanted to know it so well that I could do it in my dreams.\"\nChance of winning: 4%Language: Finnish, GermanGenre: EurodanceSpotify streams: 11.8mAsk Erika Vikman to describe her song, and she doesn't pull any punches.\"It's about orgasm.\"Full of pummelling techno beats and what appears to be a Welsh male voice choir, it's one of those tracks that's guaranteed to become part of Eurovision folklore, no matter where it comes in the final.Vikman was once hailed as the queen of Finland's tango scene but gave it up for pop, \"because I can't be very wild with that type of music.\"Citing artists like Madonna, Cher and Lady Gaga as inspiration, she's one of the few artists to take to the stage without dancers.\"Why? Because I'm selfish!\" she laughs. \"I want attention.\"\"No, it's because when I go the stage, I feel like a rock star, and when I feel like a rock star, I really don't need dancers, because it's owning my power and myself.\"She certainly owns the stage â ending her song atop a giant gold microphone that spurts fire as she's hoisted into the sky.Eagle-eyed viewers might notice, however, that her costume is a little less revealing than the one she wore for Finland's selection show, Uuden Musiikin Kilpailu.\"They said that it won't pass if we don't tone down something,\" she says, \"and one of the suggestions was my outfit.\"\"So I was like, 'Okay, if that, that's price to pay, we cover my butt'.\"That doesn't mean she's happy about it.\"The song is about owning your sexuality, and then someone comes and controls me, saying, 'you will ruin every child who is watching this show'. It's a double standard.\"Censorship or not, Vikman's odds of winning shortened dramatically after a barnstorming performance in the semi-finals.\"I have a feeling about it,\" she smiles. \"I can be the dark horse.\"\nChance of winning: 1%Language: EnglishGenre: Musical theatreSpotify streams: 3.1mAfter Thursday's semi-final, UK act Remember Monday shot up the odds... well, kind of.Formerly predicted to come 17th, they're now gunning for 11th place.But the trio - who are the first girlband to represent the UK since the 1999 - are determined to have fun, no matter what the outcome.\"This is all so surreal, beyond anything we could have imagined,\" says singer Lauren Byrne.\"It sounds so cheesy, but it is genuinely everything we've ever wanted,\" says her bandmate Charlotte Steele. \"Who gets to stand up and perform their music, with their two best friends, to millions of people? It's mental.\"\"And listen,\" adds Lauren. \"If we do really badly, we're just gonna keep coming back until we win.\"In their favour, Remember Monday's performance is chirpy and fun, drawing on their background in musical theatre. There's a dress-ripping nod to former UK winners Bucks Fizz, and their live harmonies are exquisite.\n\"They have an insane amount of experience,\" says Ace Bowerman, a creative director for Dua Lipa and Blackpink, who designed their staging.\"Their performance is constantly moving, and bringing the audience in. Ultimately, the energy we want to create is that people will want to be a part of this band.\"Maybe fans have underestimated Remember Monday's chances because West End show tunes are an untested quantity at Eurovision - but the UK's track record doesn't bode well.We'll have to wait and see what the hell (just) happens."

    "content": "As crowds gathered at a food distribution point in northern Gaza, six-year-old Ismail Abu Odeh fought his way to the front.\"Give me some,\" he called out.His bowl was filled with lentils, but as he made his way back, it was knocked out of his hands. He returned to his family's tent crying.An uncle who had managed to get some food later shared some with Ismail.The following day, no deliveries of water or food arrived at the displacement camp where he lives, located in a school in Gaza City, and the people gathered there were left with empty bottles and bowls. Ismail cried again.The BBC has spent the past two days speaking to people across Gaza, as Israelramps up its military actionand continues a more than 10-week total blockade on food, medical supplies and other aid.There are mounting warnings from the United Nations and others that the enclave ison the brink of famine.\nThe Israeli government insists there is \"no shortage\" of food in Gaza and that the \"real crisis is Hamas looting and selling aid\".Government ministers have described the stoppage of aidas a \"main pressure lever\"to secure victory over Hamas and get all the hostages out. There are still 58 hostages in Gaza, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive.Israel does not allow international journalists free access to Gaza, so our communication has been over phone calls and WhatsApp messages, and through trusted Palestinian freelancers who live in the territory.Those who spoke to the BBC described their struggle to find even one meal a day, with food kitchens shutting down because of the shortages and few items in the markets. Items that are still available are at highly inflated prices that they cannot afford, they said.A man running one of the remaining food kitchens in Gaza said he was operating \"day by day\" to find food and oil. Another man we spoke to said the kitchen he volunteered at had closed 10 days ago when supplies ran out, describing it as a \"disastrous feeling\".\nOne 23-year-old woman living in north Gaza said \"dizziness has become a constant feeling\" as well as \"general weakness and fatigue from the lack of food and medicine\".Adham al-Batrawi, 31, who used to live in the affluent city of al-Zahra but is now displaced in central Gaza, said hunger was \"one of the most difficult parts of daily life\".He said people had to get \"creative just to survive\", describing through WhatsApp messages how he would over-cook pasta and knead it into a dough before cooking it over a fire to create an imitation of bread - a staple in the Palestinian diet.\"We've invented ways to cook and eat that we never imagined we'd need,\" he said.He added that the one meal a day he had been eating recently was \"just enough to get us through the day, but it's far from enough to meet our energy needs\".\nElsewhere in central Gaza, in the city of Deir al-Balah, nurse Rewaa Mohsen said it was a struggle to provide for her two young daughters, aged three and 19 months.She said she had stockpiled nappies during the ceasefire earlier this year but that these would run out in a month.Speaking over WhatsApp on Thursday, she said her daughters had grown used to the sounds of bombing that would ring through the apartment. \"Sometimes I feel more afraid than them,\" she wrote, adding that she would distract her children with colouring books and toys.The next day, over voice note she said evacuation orders had been issued for her area before an Israeli strike hit a nearby building.When she returned to her home to \"clean the mess\",  she found that the doors and windows had been blown off.\"Thank God that I am still alive with my girls,\" she said.When asked if she would stay in the apartment, she responded: \"Where else will I go?\"Across Gaza, medics described the impact of the blockade on medical supplies and said they no longer felt safe at work following Israeli strikes targeting hospitals.Nurse Randa Saied said she was working at the European Hospital in Khan Youniswhen it was hit in an Israeli strikethis week, describing it as a moment of \"pure terror and helplessness\".Israel has long accused Hamas of using hospitals as covert bases and for weapons storage, which the group denies.The European Hospital is no longer operating, but Randa said staff and patients had moved to the nearby Nasser Hospital.\"Our patients are mothers, sons, daughters and siblings - just like us. We know deep in our hearts that our duty must not end, especially now when they need us the most,\" she said.\nStaff at Nasser and other hospitals in Gaza told the BBC the blockade meant they were running short on basic supplies like painkillers and gauze, and had to shut down some services.The US hasconfirmed that a new system for providing humanitarian aidto Palestinians in Gaza through private companies is being prepared, with Israeli forces set to secure the centres' perimeters. The United Nations has criticised the plan, saying it appears to \"weaponise\" aid.Back in Gaza City, Ismail's father said he struggled with no longer being able to provide for his six children.\"My children go to sleep hungry,\" he said. \"Sometimes I sit and cry like a little kid if I don't manage to provide food for them.\""

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpqelqpvpeqo",
    "content": "A budget bill, long touted by Donald Trump as the \"big, beautiful bill\" hit a roadblock on Friday when lawmakers from the president's own party voted against it in congress.Five Republicans joined all Democrats in delivering a stunning setback to President Trump's domestic agenda, demanding deeper budget cuts.Trump, who has muscled through close votes several times this year, urged lawmakers to unite behind the legislation. \"We don't need 'GRANDSTANDERS' in the Republican Party. STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE!,\" he posted on Truth Social.The bill's chances of success are not hopeless, but its failure gives the Trump administration its first legislative bruise of the year.\nSupport for the bill among Republicans varies. Some hard-liners want to see the budget cuts go further, while other Republicans have expressed concern about cuts to programmes like Medicaid, which their constituents are dependent on.The five Republicans who voted against the measure in the procedural vote said they would continue to withhold support unless Speaker Mike Johnson agreed to further cut Medicaid, a healthcare programme for lower-income Americans.They also want Johnson to include a full repeal of green energy tax cuts, implemented by Democrats, in the bill.\"This bill falls profoundly short,\" said Texas Republican Chip Roy, who voted against the measure.  \"It does not do what we say it does with respect to deficits.\"Moody's downgrades US credit rating citing rising debtFour obstacles for Republican rebels in Trump's 'big, beautiful' tax billThe proposed legislation would extend tax cuts implemented during Trump's first administration.While Trump touts the bill's inclusion of a no tax on tips policy, some critics argue the bill benefits wealthy Americans.Democrats, who overwhelmingly oppose the bill, have been urging the reconsideration of Medicaid cuts and spending cuts to the Affordable care Act which offers millions of Americans subsidised health insurance.\"No other previous bill, no other previous law, no other previous event caused so many millions of Americans to lose their healthcare. Not even the Great Depression,\" Pennsylvania Democrat Brendan Boyle said.If passed, the tax cuts would cost $3.72 trillion (Â£2.8t) over ten years, according to congress's bipartisan Joint Tax Committee."

    "title": "The poison paradox: How Australia's deadliest animals save lives",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0lnp3ny4wro",
    "content": "With a pair of bright pink tweezers in hand, Emma Teni is delicately wrestling a large and leggy spider in a small plastic pot.\"He's posing,\" the spider-keeper jests as it rears up on its back legs. It is exactly what she's trying to achieve - that way she can suck the venom from its fangs using a small pipette.Emma works from a tiny office known as the spider milking room. On a typical day, she milks - or extracts the venom from - 80 of these Sydney funnel-web spiders.On three of the four walls there are floor-to-ceiling shelves stacked full of the arachnids, with a black curtain pulled across to keep them calm.The remaining wall is actually a window. Through it, a small child stares, both fascinated and horrified, as Ms Teni works. Little do they know that the palm-sized spider she's handling could kill them in a matter of minutes.\"Sydney funnel-webs are arguably the most deadly spider in the world,\" Emma says matter-of-factly.Australia is famously full of such deadly animals - and this room at the Australian Reptile Park plays a critical part in a government antivenom programme, which saves lives on a continent where it's often joked that everything wants to kill you.\nWhile the quickest recorded death from a Sydney funnel-web spider was a toddler at 13 minutes, the average is closer to 76 minutes - and first aid gives you an even better chance of surviving.So successful is the antivenom programme here at the Australian Reptile Park that nobody has been killed by one since it started in 1981.The scheme relies, however, on members of the public either catching the spiders or collecting their egg sacs.In a van plastered with a giant crocodile sticker, each week Ms Teni's team drives all over Australia's most famous city, picking up Sydney funnel-webs that have been handed in at drop-off points such as local veterinary practices.\nThere are two reasons why these spiders are so dangerous, she explains: not only is their venom extremely potent, but they also live exclusively in a densely populated region where they're more likely to encounter humans.Handyman Charlie Simpson is one such person. He moved into his first home with his girlfriend a few months ago, and the keen gardener has already found two Sydney funnel-webs. He took the second spider to the vet, where Ms Teni picked it up shortly after.\"I had gloves on at the time, but realistically I should have had leather gloves on because their fangs are so big and strong,\" the 26-year-old says.\"I [just thought] I had better catch it because I kept getting told you're meant to take them back to be milked, because it's so critical.\"\"This is curing my fear of spiders,\" he jokes.As Ms Teni offloads one arachnid that was delivered to her in a Vegemite jar, she stresses her team isn't telling Australians to go looking for the spiders and \"throw themselves into danger\".Rather, they're asking that if someone comes across one, they safely capture it rather than kill it.\"Saying that this is the world's most deadly spider and then [asking the public to] catch it and bring it to us does sound counter-intuitive,\" she says.\"[But] that spider there now, thanks to Charlie, willâ¦ effectively save someone's life.\"\nAll of the spiders her team collects get brought back to the Australian Reptile Park where they are catalogued, sorted by sex and stored.Any females that get dropped off are considered for a breeding programme, which helps supplement the number of spiders donated by the public.Meanwhile, the males, which are six to seven times more toxic than the females, are used for the antivenom programme and milked every two weeks, Emma explains.The pipette she uses to remove the venom from the fangs is attached to a suction hose - crucial for collecting as much venom as possible, since each spider provides only small amounts.While a few drops is enough to kill, scientists need to milk 200 of these spiders to have enough to fill one vial of antivenom.A marine biologist by training, Emma never expected to spend her days milking spiders. In fact, she started off working with seals.But now she wouldn't have it any other way. Emma loves all things arachnid, and goes under various nicknames - spider girl, spider mama, even \"weirdo\", as her daughter calls her.Friends, family and neighbours rely on her for her knowledge of Australia's creepy crawlies.\"Some girls arrive home to flowers on their doorstep,\" jokes Emma. \"For me it's not unusual to arrive home to a spider in a jar.\"\nSpiders represent just one small part of what the Australian Reptile Park does. It's also been providing snake venom to the government since the 1950s.According to the World Health Organisation, as many as 140,000 people die across the world from snake bites every year, and three times that many are left disabled.In Australia though, those numbers are far lower: between one and four people each year, thanks to its successful antivenom programme.Removing a King Brown snake from its storage locker, Billy Collett, the park's operations manager, brings it to the table in front of him.With his bare hands, he secures its head and puts its jaws over a shot glass covered in cling film.\n\"They are very uninclined to bite but once they go, you just see it pouring out of the fangs,\" Mr Collett says, as yellow venom drips to the bottom.\"That is enough to kill all of us in the room five times over - maybe more.\"Then he switches to a more reassuring tone: \"They're not looking for people to bite. We're too big for them to eat; they don't want to waste their venom on us. They just want to be left alone.\"\"To get bitten by a venomous snake, you've got to really annoy it, provoke it,\" he adds, noting that bites often occur when someone is trying to kill one of the reptiles.There's a fridge in the corner of the room where the raw venom Mr Collett is collecting is stored. It's full of vials labelled \"Death Adder\", \"Taipan\", \"Tiger Snake\" and \"Eastern Brown\".The last of these is the second-most venomous snake in the world, and the one that's most likely to bite you here, in Australia.\nThis venom gets freeze-dried and sent to CSL Seqirus, a lab in Melbourne, where it's turned into an antidote in a process that can take up to 18 months.The first step is to produce what's known as hyper-immune plasma. In the case of snakes, controlled doses of the venom are injected into horses, because they are larger animals with a strong immune system.The venom of Sydney funnel-web spiders goes into rabbits, which are immune to the toxins. The animals are injected with increasing doses to build up their antibodies. In some cases, that step alone can take almost a year.The animal's supercharged plasma is removed from the blood, and then the antibodies are isolated from the plasma before they're bottled, ready to be administered.CSL Seqirus makes 7,000 vials a year â including snake, spider, stonefish and box jellyfish antivenoms - and they are valid for 36 months. The challenge then is to ensure everyone who needs it has supplies.\"It's an enormous undertaking,\" says Dr Jules Bayliss, who leads the antivenom development team at CSL Seqirus.\"First and foremost we want to see them in major rural and remote areas that these creatures are likely to be in.\"Vials are distributed depending on the species in each area. Taipans, for example, are in northern parts of Australia, so there's no need for their antivenom in Tasmania.Antivenom is also given to the Royal Flying Doctors, who access some of the nation's most remote communities, as well as Australian navy and cargo ships for sailors at risk of sea snake bites.\nPapua New Guinea also receives about 600 vials a year. The country was once connected to Australia by a land bridge, and shares many of the same snake species, so the Australian government gives the antivenom for free â snake diplomacy, if you like.\"To be honest, we probably have the most impact in Papua New Guinea, more so than Australia, because of the number of snake bites and deaths they have,\" says CSL Seqirus executive Chris Larkin. To date, they reckon they've saved 2,000 lives.Back at the park, Mr Collett jokes about the nickname of \"danger noodles\" that is sometimes given to his serpentine colleagues â a classic Australian trait of making light of something that gives so many visitors nightmares.Mr Collett, though, is clear: these animals should not put people off from visiting.\"Snakes aren't just cruising down the streets attacking Brits - it doesn't work like that,\" he jokes.\"If you're going to get bitten by a snake, Australia's the best place â we've got the best antivenom. It's free. The treatment is unreal.\""

    "content": "A New Jersey man who stabbed and partially blinded novelist Sir Salman Rushdie on a New York lecture stage was sentenced to 25 years in prison on Friday.Hadi Matar, 27, was convicted of attempted murder and assault earlier this year.Sir Salman was on stage speaking before an audience in August 2022, when he was stabbed multiple times in the face and neck. The attack left him blind in one eye, with damage to his liver and a paralysed hand caused by nerve damage to his arm.The attack came 35 years after Sir Salman's controversial novel The Satanic Verses, which had long made him the target of death threats for its portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad.\nMatar received the maximum 25-year sentence for the attempted murder of Sir Salman.He was also found guilty of assault for wounding the person who was interviewing Sir Salman, Henry Reese, and sentenced to seven years plus three years post-release for that assault.The sentences must run concurrently because both victims were injured in the same event, Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt said on Friday.Before being sentenced, Matar stood and made a statement about freedom of speech in which he called Rushdie a hypocrite, according to the Associated Press.\"Salman Rushdie wants to disrespect other people,\" said Matar, clad in white-striped jail clothing and wearing handcuffs. \"He wants to be a bully, he wants to bully other people. I don't agree with that.\"Sir Salman was not in the court for his assailant's sentencing on Friday.\nMatar was convicted of attempted murder and assault in February, 2025, following an intense trial during which Sir Salman detailed the moment when he felt certain that he was going to die.During the two-week trial, he testified that he saw a man rushing towards him while on stage at the historic arts institute in Chautauqua, New York.He said his assailant's eyes \"were dark and seemed very ferocious\".Sir Salman told the court he initially did not realise he had been stabbed, thinking instead that he had been punched.Matar stabbed Sir Salman 15 times in total including to his cheek, chest, eye, neck and thigh.Prosecutors argued that the attack was targeted.\"There were a lot of people around that day but there was only one person who was targeted,\" prosecuting lawyer Jason Schmidt then told the jury.Defence lawyer Andrew Brautigan had argued that prosecutors failed to prove Matar intended to kill Sir Salman.Matar, who pleaded not guilty, did not testify in his defence. His lawyers did not call any witnesses of their own.\"I don't think he's a very good person,\" Matar said about the author in a 2022 New York Post story. \"He's someone who attacked Islam.\"Matar praised Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, for calling for Sir Salman's execution.The attack took place some 35 years after Sir Salman's controversial novel The Satanic Verses was published.The novel, inspired by the life of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad, sparked outrage among some Muslims, who considered its content to be blasphemous.Sir Salman faced countless death threats and was forced into hiding for nine years after Iran's religious leader issued a fatwa - or decree - calling for the author's death due to the book.But in recent years, the author said he believed the threats against him had diminished.Just before the attack Sir Salman told a German magazine he felt his life was \"relatively normal\".The British-Indian novelist later detailed his experience and long road to recovery in a memoir called Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder."

A MrBeast representative denied some of the accusations.\nThe spokesperson told the BBC: \"No advertisement material was shot on any archaeological sites overseen by INAH (National Institute of Anthropology and History).\"In the video, the scene promoting the chocolate snack appears to be filmed at the influencer's camping site.The spokesperson also said the video was \"meant to highlight these treasured Mayan sites in Mexico\" and that it was \"unfortunate that this has turned into a political issue - hopefully it can lead to a productive dialogue and encourages people to visit these unique historical treasures\".Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum on Wednesday called for an investigation into the conditions under which the filming permit had been granted.In the video's caption, MrBeast thanks Mexican tourism and government authorities for permission to film in the sites, while also plugging links to his chocolate product.The video shows him and his team exploring areas of restricted access in the Mayan cities of Calakmul and ChichÃ©n ItzÃ¡. At one point he says \"I can't believe the government's letting us do this.\"They are also shown appearing to descend into a pyramid from a helicopter and in another scene are shown handling an ancient pre-Hispanic mask.But heritage authorities said these were \"false assertions\" and accused the YouTuber of presenting misinformation. INAH said MrBeast had never held a real pre-Hispanic mask and there appeared to have been extensive post-production editing in the video - such as the helicopter scene.\"All of these are false assertions that obey the theatricality of the YouTuber in question,\" its statement on Monday read.Mexico's Secretary of Culture Claudia Curiel de Icaza said on Thursday that, although they had authorised the permit for MrBeast to film, they had never authorised the publication of false information or the use of heritage site images for trademark advertising.\"We disapprove of any commercial pursuit that distorts the value of archaeological sites, which are a legacy of our indigenous cultures and the pride of our nation,\" she said.She added that, although Mexico was open to content that contributes to the \"knowledge and dissemination of Mexico's archaeological and cultural heritage\" it was firmly against those who \"take advantage of the willingness of institutions\".She said INAH would consider \"administrative sanctions\" against Full Circle Media, who was issued the permit to film. The BBC has sought comment from the firm.MrBeast, dubbed the King of YouTube, is the most-subscribed to person on the platform, with 395 million followers. His Mayan pyramids video was published on 10 May."

He had denied wrongdoing, although prosecutors said he remained under suspicion.Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard released a statement saying her thoughts were with the diplomat's family, friends and colleagues and said it had been a difficult day.She said she could not go into further details about the case. Police said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death.\nFormer foreign minister Carl Bildt described the \"tragically deceased ambassador\" as extremely gifted and competent, who had worked in various roles within the foreign ministry.Swedish reports said he had spent long periods stationed outside Europe, most recently as an ambassador. Asked to confirm whether the man who died was an ambassador, his lawyer Anton Strand said he had no comment.Images of the door to the diplomat's flat on Swedish TV showed that it had been forced open at the time of his arrest.The diplomat had sought medical treatment for injuries and submitted a report alleging use of excessive force at the time. SÃ¤po said the arrest had been peaceful.Mr Strand said in a statement to the BBC: \"I have ensured his formal report about abuse during the arrest has arrived to the special investigations unit. An investigation has started regarding this.\"Unconfirmed reports from public broadcaster SVT suggest SÃ¤po had been investigating a possible link to the sudden resignation of the new national security adviser, Tobias Thyberg, who quit hours a day after taking on the role.Hours before he resigned, sensitive pictures of him on the dating app Grindr had been sent anonymously to the government.Sweden's national security adviser quits over Grindr imagesMr Strand made no comment on that but said he had received the news of his client's death early on Friday and his thoughts were with his family.Prosecutor Per Lindqvist told Swedish TV that the death was very regrettable and a preliminary investigation into suspected espionage was not complete.Swedish reports said the man was in his 50s and had returned to his home in central Stockholm temporarily after a long period abroad."

    "title": "US 'troubled' by humanitarian situation in Gaza, Rubio tells BBC",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gewwg1wlvo",
    "content": "The top US diplomat Marco Rubio has said the US is \"troubled\" by the humanitarian situation in Gaza.His comments came as at least 114 Palestinians were killed in Israeli air strikes on Thursday, health officials said.Asked by the BBC if the Trump administration remained fully behind the nature of Israel's military action given the scale of the recent Israeli attacks and its bombing of hospitals, he once again called on Hamas to surrender and release hostages and said there could be no peace so long as the group exists.\"That said, we're not immune or in any way insensitive to the suffering of the people of Gaza, and I know that there's opportunities here to provide aid for them,\" he said.\nGaza has been under a complete Israeli blockade of all food and other humanitarian supplies for 10 weeks. Israeli forces have been intensifying their bombardment of what they say are Hamas fighters and infrastructure ahead of a planned expansion of their ground offensive in Gaza.Rubio's comments - made after a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Turkey - appeared to be a reference to a controversial Israeli-American proposal to use private providers to set up aid collection points in Gaza. That plan has been rejected by the UN as unethical and unworkable.They come as Donald Trump is visiting the region and indirect negotiations on a new ceasefire and hostage release deal between Hamas and Israel continue.Hamas meanwhile accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of \"undermin[ing] mediation efforts by deliberate military escalation\".An Israeli government spokesman said Israel wanted negotiations on hostage releases to succeed, but that they would take place while Hamas was under \"military pressure\".The US is Israel's main arms supplier and the language used by Rubio is unusual. Previously he has responded to questions about Palestinian civilian casualties only by calling on Hamas to surrender. It also comes amid recent reports of a rift between Trump and Netanyahu.\nBBC joins Gaza children as they are evacuated to Jordan for treatmentConstruction sites appear in Gaza ahead of Israeli-US aid plan rejected by UN, images showIsrael issues major evacuation order for Palestinians sheltering in Gaza City\nIn southern Gaza the streets of Khan Younis were filled with funeral processions and grieving families on Thursday morning, following what residents said were the deadliest set of air strikes in the city since Israel resumed its offensive almost two months ago.Some 56 people, including women and children, were killed when homes and tents sheltering displaced families were bombed overnight in the city, the local Nasser hospital said.The Israeli military said it struck Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters in southern Gaza.One man told BBC Arabic's Middle East Daily programme that Nasser hospital's mortuary was \"filled beyond capacity\", and that several bodies had to be placed in the corridor before they could be buried.Doctors were forced to treat wounded people, including those with burns, amputations and internal bleeding, on stretchers, benches and on the floor due to a lack of beds, he said.\"Among those killed today were 36 children... Entire families have been wiped from the civil registry,\" he added. \"Tragically, this level of destruction has become part of daily life.\"One video shared by a local activist showed medics laying dozens of bodies on the ground at a local cemetery. An imam stood nearby leading prayers for hundreds of mourners gathered behind him in orderly rows.Safaa al-Bayouk, a 42-year-old mother of six, said her sons Muath, who was six weeks old, and Moataz, who was one year and four months, were killed in one of the strikes.\"I gave them dinner and they went to sleep. It was a normal day... [then] the world turned upside down,\" she told Reuters news agency.Reem al-Zanaty, 13, said her uncle's family, including her 12-year-old cousin Menna, were killed when their two homes were bombed.\"We didn't feel or hear anything until we woke up with rubble on us,\" she said. \"The Civil Defence did not come. I will tell you honestly we pulled ourselves [out]. My father helped us.\"Medics said local journalist Hassan Samour, who worked for Hamas-run al-Aqsa Radio, was killed along with 11 members of his family when their home in the eastern Bani Suheila neighbourhood was struck.\nIn northern Gaza, the Civil Defence agency said its first responders had recovered the bodies of four people following Israeli strikes in the northern town of Beit Lahia and two others in the central town of Deir al-Balah.Later, spokesman Mahmoud Basal reported that an Israeli strike on a home in Jabalia town had killed all five members of the Shihab family.Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that 15 people were killed, including 11 children, when the al-Tawbah health clinic and prayer hall in the al-Fakhouri area of Jabalia refugee camp was bombed.A graphic video posted online purportedly from the scene showed two bodies covered in debris on a street next to a badly damaged building.\"An indescribable crime, in all meanings of the word. They were safe in a medical clinic, civilians, children, women, men, something a person can't fathom, for them to release a military missile on a medical clinic, on people and passers-by,\" resident Yehya Abu Jalhoum told Reuters.Amir Selha, a 43-year-old resident of northern Gaza, told AFP news agency: \"Tank shells are striking around the clock, and the area is packed with people and tents.\"He also said Israeli military drones had dropped leaflets over his neighbourhood warning residents to move south.The military said it had struck 130 \"terror targets\" throughout Gaza over the past two days, including cells of fighters, rocket launchers and infrastructure sites.On Wednesday, Israeli strikes killed at least 80 people across the territory, including 59 in Jabalia town and refugee camp, according to hospitals and the Civil Defence.The military said it struck Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters in the north on Tuesday night. It had warned residents of Jabalia and neighbouring areas to evacuate on Tuesday after rockets were launched into Israel.Israeli evacuation orders issued on Wednesday afternoon also caused panic among residents of a crowded area of Gaza City, in the north.The Israeli military said a hospital, a university and several schools sheltering displaced people in the Rimal neighbourhood had become \"terrorist strongholds\" and that it would soon attack them with \"intense force\".\nSeparately, a US-backed organisation said it would start work in Gaza within two weeks as part of a new and heavily criticised US-Israeli aid distribution plan.The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said it had asked Israel to let the UN and others resume deliveries until it was set up, and also to allow it to set up aid distribution sites in the north as well as the south.Israel's UN envoy, Danny Danon, said he was \"not familiar with those requests\", but he confirmed that the \"major operation\" would start very soon.UN spokesperson Farhan Haq meanwhile reiterated that it would not participate in the plan, saying it \"does not accord with out basic principles, including those of impartiality, neutrality [and] independence\".Israel has not allowed any aid or other supplies into Gaza for 10 weeks, and an assessment by the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) has warned that half a million people face starvation.Israel imposed the blockade on 2 March and resumed its offensive against Hamas two weeks later, ending a two-month ceasefire. It said it wanted to put pressure on Hamas to release its remaining 58 hostages, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive.The UN has said Israel is obliged under international law to ensure food and medical supplies for Gaza's population. Israel has said it is complying with international law and there is no shortage of food.Israel launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 53,010 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 2,876 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

    "content": "Ethiopia's main opposition party has condemned a ban on its activities, saying it posed a \"serious threat\" to the 2022 peace deal that ended two years of conflict in the northern Tigray region.The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) has called for the African Union to mediate with the federal government after the electoral agency revoked its legal status as a party.The party, which governs Tigray and dominated the entire country for many years, was on Wednesday banned for failing to hold a general assembly.The decision follows months of political tensions in Tigray and comes ahead of nationwide elections that are due to take place by June next year at the latest.\nThe party led a coalition that overthrew the government in 1991 and ruled Ethiopia until 2019 when it was dissolved a year after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed had taken power.He then formed a new national party, a move rejected by the TPLF.The dispute culminated in a civil war that saw tens of thousands of people killed and millions forced from their homes in northern Ethiopia before a truce was signed in November 2022.'No-one can handle another war' - Tigrayans fear fresh Ethiopian conflictThe party runs Tigray's interim administration which was established in 2023 as part of the peace deal, known as the Pretoria peace agreement.But the party has been unable to conduct internal elections because of a split, with two factions laying claim to control of the party.The National Election Board of Ethiopia, which supervises the conduct of political parties, on Wednesday \"resolved to formally deregister\" the  TPLF on the grounds that it had failed to hold a general assembly.But the party has protested against the move and called on the African Union to put \"pressure\" on the federal government to suspend the enforcement of the ban.In a letter to the AU, the party said the ban \"denies the TPLF a right it had reclaimed through the Pretoria Agreement and poses a serious threat to the foundation of the peace process\".It added that the peace deal stipulated that both parties recognise each other's legitimacy and any political issue should be resolved through dialogue.TPLF deputy chairman Ammanuel Assefa told the BBC that the decision by the electoral board could \"damage the Pretoria agreement\" which \"is going to be dangerous\".\"This isn't just about TPLF, but also about undermining what people have sacrificed,\" Ammanuel added.Delays in implementing the terms of the agreement, including the return of some one million people displaced by the war, have fuelled fears of fresh violence in Tigray.Several countries including the US, UK and the European Union have warned about the escalating tension, saying there must be \"no return to violence\".Additional reporting by Girmay Gebru\n'I lost my leg on the way home from school'How war has hurt Ethiopia's Olympic hopesHow a massacre in the sacred city of Aksum unfoldedWhy Ethiopia is so alarmed by an Egypt-Somalia alliance\nGo toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter@BBCAfrica, on Facebook atBBC Africaor on Instagram atbbcafrica"

    "content": "A 1,000 year-old human skeleton which was buried sitting cross-legged in India has been moved to a museum six years after it was excavated.The BBC had reportedearlier this monththat the skeleton had been left inside an unprotected tarpaulin shelter close to the excavation site in western Gujarat state since 2019 because of bureaucratic wrangling.On Thursday, the skeleton was shifted to a local museum, just a few miles away from where it was unearthed.Authorities say that it will be placed on display for the public after administrative procedures are completed.\nMahendra Surela, curator of the Archaeological Experiential Museum in Vadnagar where the skeleton has now been shifted, told the BBC that the skeleton was transported with \"utmost care\" and under the supervision of several experts.He added that officials of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) - the agency responsible for preservation of archaeological research - will examine the skeleton before taking a decision on where and how the skeleton should be displayed in the museum.It is currently placed next to the reception and is fenced in by a protective barrier.\"It is likely that we may shift it to the second floor, where a photograph of the skeleton is already placed,\" Mr Surela said.Archaeologist Abhijit Ambekar, who discovered the skeleton, said that he was happy that the significant find was getting the attention it deserved.Ambekar had earlier told the BBC that the skeleton was a rare discovery as similar remains had been found at only three other sites in India.\nBut as officials argued over who should take charge of the skeleton, it remained in a make-shift tent close to the excavation site, unprotected by security guards and exposed to natural elements.Experts say that the skeleton likely belongs to the Solanki period. The Solanki dynasty, also known as the Chaulukya dynasty, ruled over parts of modern-day Gujarat between 940 to 1300 CE.The skeleton had managed to survive the passage of time because the soil around it had remained undisturbed and displayed characteristics that aided preservation.Mr Ambekar said that the remains could shed light on the phenomenon of \"samadhi burials\" - an ancient burial practice among Hindus where revered figures were buried rather than cremated."

Extra police and soldiers were also sent to the region."

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c780xn5p72jo",
    "content": "Israel has qualified for Eurovision's grand final on Saturday, hours after protesters tried to disrupt the country's dress rehearsal.Yuval Raphael, 24, was performing New Day Will Rise during a preview show on Thursday afternoon when six people with whistles and \"oversized\" Palestinian flags obstructed her act. Under the arena rules, all flags are allowed but there are limits on size.Swiss broadcaster SRG SSR, which is organising the event, said the audience members were quickly ejected fromthe St Jakobshalle arena.Israel's participation in Eurovision has been a source of controversy, as its military intensifies its bombardment of Gaza, and enforces blockades of all food and other humanitarian supplies.\nIn recent weeks, broadcasters in Spain, Ireland and Slovenia have called for a debate on Israel's involvement, and there have been small protests in the streets of Basel, Switzerland where this year's contest is taking place.The incident during Thursday's dress rehearsal did not disrupt Raphael's performance, and her appearance in the televised semi-final passed without further demonstrations.Speaking to the BBC earlier this week, Raphael said her team had played audience noises over her rehearsals, \"so I can practise when there is distractions in the background.\"The singer clasped her hands together, then blew a kiss towards the sky when it was announced she would progress to the final.Despite the ongoing tension, her song is currently among the favourites to win, according to bookmakers.\nThe 10 acts who succeeded in Thursday's public vote were:Armenia: PARG â SURVIVORAustria: JJ â Wasted LoveDenmark: Sissal â HallucinationFinland: Erika Vikman â ICH KOMMEGreece: Klavdia â AsteromÃ¡taIsrael: Yuval Raphael â New Day Will RiseLatvia: Tautumeitas â Bur Man LaimiLithuania: Katarsis â Tavo AkysLuxembourg: Laura Thorn â La PoupÃ©e Monte Le Son(pictured)Malta: Miriana Conte â SERVINGWhich means the six countries eliminated were Australia, Czechia, Georgia, Ireland, Montenegro and Serbia.Australia's elimination was the biggest shock. Their innuendo-laden pop anthem Milkshake Man had received a warm reception ahead of the contest but, on the night, viewers proved to be lactose intolerant.Ireland also crashed out, a year after Bambie Thug earned the country a sixth-place finish.The country has now failed to qualify on eight of their last 10 attempts. The continuation of that losing streak will cause much soul-searching in the nation that's tied with Sweden for the most Eurovision victories of all time: Seven in total.\nThe second semi-final also gave viewers their first chance to see the UK's act, Remember Monday.The girl band delivered a whimsical staging of their song, What The Hell Just Happened? - dancing around a fallen chandelier in Bridgerton-inspired outfits, as they sang about a messy night on the tiles.With effortless three-part harmonies, they put to rest the dodgy vocal performances that plagued Olly Alexander and Mae Muller in 2024 and 2023.And they were spared the public vote, for now. The UK automatically qualifies for the final as one of the \"Big Five\" countries who make outsized financial contributions to Eurovision.\nSwedish entry KAJ are currently favourites to win the 2025 contest, with their sweaty sauna anthem Bara Bada Bastu.Austrian counter-tenor JJ, whose operatic pop song Wasted Love is the second favourite, was one of the 10 acts voted through after Thursday's show.In an eye-catching performance, the 24-year-old was tossed around the stage in a rickety sailing boat, reflecting the turbulent emotional waters of his lyrics.Elsewhere, the contest had all the traditional Eurovision trappings: Spandex, sequins, gale-force wind machines, and no fewer than 10 on-stage costume changes.\nAmong the more novel elements were a \"sand tornado\" during France's performance, and Maltese contestant Miriana Conte bouncing on a bright red medicine ball for her self-empowerment anthem, Serving.Latvian folk band Tautumeitas took a more ethereal approach with their close-harmony incantation Bur Man Laimi, which literally translates as \"a chant for happiness\".Dressed in gold bodysuits with branch and vine detailing, they transported the audience to an enchanted forest for a song that emphasised the connection between humanity and nature.The band were considered an outlier for the final, but leapfrogged over higher profile songs from Ireland and Czechia - precisely because they stood out.Also making a mark was Finnish singer Erika Vikman, who ended the show with a bang.Her track Ich Komme is a sex-positive club anthem that saw with the singer rising above the audience astride a giant, fire-spouting golden microphone.Like her, it soared into Saturday's grand final - where the song's predicted to land in the top 10.\nSaturday's show will take place in Basel's St Jackobshalle from 20:00 BST / 21:00 Swiss time.The ceremony will be broadcast live on BBC One and BBC Radio 2, with full live commentary on the BBC News website."

    "content": "Spectators could fly through the Los Angeles skies and escape the city's notorious traffic during the 2028 Olympic Games if the organisers have their way.LA28, the committee charged with planning the city's third Summer Games, have announced a partnership with Archer Aviation to provide an air taxi service during both the Olympic and Paralympic Games.The company says it plans to use a fleet of aircraft to ferry fans to and from venues, LA28 announced on Thursday.Flying taxis have been a longstanding dream. They were planned to debut in the Paris Games in 2024, but were not certified by Europe's air safety agency in time.\nSimilarly, Archer Aviation has not yet been certified by the US Federal Aviation Administration, meaning the aircraft are not ready yet for commercial use. It's founder and CEO has said he hoped to have that key signoff - a Type Certification that says it meets design and safety standards - by the aviation regulator this year.If they receive certification in time for the 2028 Games, the air taxis would offer 10-20 minute flights to residents and visitors and fly between select destinations, including several of the largest Olympic venues in the region.It is unclear how much each trip would cost, but Archer Aviation's founder and CEO Adam Goldstein said he wants to keep prices comparable to a high-end Uber, according to the Los Angeles Times.Like the popular ride-hailing service, customers would be able to request an air taxi through an app. The aircraft can carry up to four people and operates similarly to a helicopter in its take-offs and landings.The Hollywood Olympics: All you need to know about Los Angeles 2028Olympic flag arrives in Los AngelesThe piloted Midnight aircraft is part of a family of vehicles called \"eVTOLs\" - which stands for electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft.Archer is among several eVTOL makers seeking to change travel in congested urban cities by offering short-haul air travel.The industry has seen many hurdles, including battery density, and none of the aircraft have yet been approved by the FAA.Archer's Midnight aircraft is built with 12 engines and propellers, and produces \"less noise and emissions than a traditional helicopter\", according to LA28.Archer Aviation hopes it will be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) \"at similar levels of safety as commercial airliners\".\"We want to transform the way people get around Los Angeles and leave a legacy that shapes the future of transportation in America,\" Mr Goldstein said in a statement. \"There's no better time to do that than during the LA28 Games.\"Safety, regulations and investment have proved a big hurdle for companies trying to introduce flying taxis. Despite the setbacks and delays, many still believe they could be the future of transportation.Archer Aviation remains confident its aircraft can buck recent trends, and sees the 2028 Olympics as a way to introduce them to the world.The UK government announced the Future of Flight action plan in 2024, predicting that the first flying taxi could take off in the UK by 2026 and become a regular sight in the skies.Los Angeles has previously hosted the Olympics in 1984 and 1932, making this the third time the city has hosted the Summer Games. The city has announced the 2028 Games will not allow cars, a tall order after plans were nixed to expand the area's transit system."

His lawyer has said those behind the accusations are after the musician's money, and he welcomed the police investigation \"because exposure to the truth is a powerful thing\".\n\"We feel confident that a determination will be made that Mr Robinson did nothing wrong, and that this is a desperate attempt to prejudice public opinion and make even more of a media circus than the Plaintiffs were previously able to create,\" the attorney, Christopher Frost, said in a statement to the BBC.He argued the police investigation was only opened because the plaintiffs filed a formal report with their allegations and said the claims were \"manufactured\" and designed to \"tarnish the good names\" of the musician and his wife, who is alsonamed in the lawsuitand accused of contributing to a hostile work environment.The sheriff's department told the BBC in a statement that its Special Victims Bureau was \"actively investigating criminal allegations involving William Robinson AKA 'Smokey Robinson.' The investigation is in the early stages, and we have no further comment.\"Thewomen filed a lawsuitin Los Angeles Superior Court on 6 May under the pseudonyms Jane Doe 1, 2, 3 and 4.In the 27-page legal action, they allege several incidents that they say dated back to 2006, and accuse Mr Robinson of pressuring them into sex.All four women, who are of Hispanic descent, said they had not come forward until now because they feared losing their livelihoods, familial reprisal or embarrassment. Some were concerned the allegations could affect their immigration status.They are seeking at least $50m (Â£38m) in damages and a jury trial.Mr Robinson was Motown's first hitmaker, writing number one records like Mary Wells' My Guy and The Temptations' My Girl.He was both a talent scout for the record label and one of its most prominent recording artists in his own right, known for songs like Tracks of My Tears, Shop Around and Tears of a Clown.He has spots in both the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and claims to have credits on more than 4,000 songs.The women's lawyers held a press conference last week after filing the lawsuit, accusing Mr Robinson of being a \"serial and sick rapist\" who \"must be stopped\".Mr Robinson's legal team called the event a \"bizarre\" attempt\"to enlist the public as an unwitting participant in the media circus they are trying to create\".\"We will have more to say in the coming days as we make our legal response, and in time Mr Robinson will respond in his own words,\" Mr Frost said, noting that the musician's legal team plans to ask for the case to be dismissed.\"We ask anyone following this case to reserve judgment as the evidence comes to light and all the actual facts of the case unfold.\""

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04en9wllpxo",
    "content": "Australia's most-decorated living soldier Ben Roberts-Smith, has lost an appeal against a landmark defamation judgement which found he committed war crimes.A judge in 2023 ruled that news articles alleging the Victoria Cross recipient had murdered four unarmed Afghans were true, but Mr Roberts-Smith had argued the judge made legal errors.The civil trial was the first time in history any court has assessed claims of war crimes by Australian forces.A panel of three Federal Court judges on Friday unanimously upheld the original judgement, though Mr Roberts-Smith has said he will appeal the decision to the High Court of Australia \"immediately\".\n\"I continue to maintain my innocence and deny these egregious spiteful allegations,\" he said in a statement.Mr Roberts-Smith, who left the defence force in 2013,  has not been charged over any of the claims in a criminal court, where there is a higher burden of proof.The former special forces corporal sued three Australian newspapers over a series of articles alleging serious misconduct while he was deployed in Afghanistan between 2009 and 2012 as part of a US-led military coalition.At the time the articles were published in 2018, Mr Roberts-Smith was considered a national hero, having been awarded Australia's highest military honour for single-handedly overpowering Taliban fighters attacking his Special Air Service (SAS) platoon.The 46-year-old argued the alleged killings occurred legally during combat or did not happen at all, claiming the papers ruined his life with their reports.His defamation case - which some have dubbed \"the trial of the century\" in Australia - lasted over 120 days and is now rumoured to have cost up to A$35m ($22.5m; Â£16.9m).\nIn June 2023 Federal Court Justice Antony Besanko threw out the case against The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald, and The Canberra Times, ruling it was \"substantially true\" that Mr Roberts-Smith had murdered unarmed Afghan prisoners and civilians and bullied fellow soldiers.He also found that Mr Roberts-Smith lied to cover up his misconduct and threatened witnesses.Additional allegations that he had punched his lover, threatened a peer, and committed two other murders were not proven to the \"balance of probabilities\" standard required in civil cases.The \"heart\" of the appeal case was that Justice Besanko didn't given enough weight to Mr Roberts-Smith's presumption of innocence, his barrister Bret Walker, SC said.There is a legal principle requiring judges to proceed carefully when dealing with civil cases that involve serious allegations and in making findings which carry grave consequences.Mr Walker argued that meant the evidence presented by the newspapers fell short of the standard required.Months after the appeal case had closed, Mr Roberts-Smith's legal team earlier this year sought to reopen it, alleging misconduct by one of the reporters at the centre of the case.They argued there was a miscarriage of justice because Nick McKenzie, one of the journalists who wrote the articles at the centre of the case, allegedly unlawfully obtained details about Mr Roberts-Smith's legal strategy.The legal team pointed to a leaked phone call between Mr McKenzie and a witness - which The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald, and The Canberra Times said may have been recorded illegally.But on Friday, the trio of judges rejected that argument too.They said \"the evidence was sufficiently cogent to support the findings that the appellant murdered four Afghan men\".\"To the extent that we have discerned error in the reasons of the primary judge, the errors were inconsequential,\" they added.They also ordered Mr Roberts-Smith to pay the newspapers' legal costs.In a statement, Mr McKenzie called the ruling an \"emphatic win\".He thanked the SAS soldiers who \"fought for the Australian public to learn the truth\", and paid tribute to the Afghan \"victims of [Mr] Roberts-Smith\".\"It should not be left to journalists and brave soldiers to stand up to a war criminal,\" he said. \"Australian authorities must hold Ben Roberts-Smith accountable before our criminal justice system.\""

Primary jurisdiction is with SS [Secret Service] on these matters and we, the FBI, will provide all necessary support.\"Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said on X: \"Disgraced former FBI Director James Comey just called for the assassination of Trump.\"She said her department and the Secret Service would investigate the matter.White House Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Scavino posted on X, accusing Comey of \"a plea to bad actors/terrorists to assassinate the POTUS' while traveling internationally\", referring to Trump's current tour of the Middle East.The president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, also responded on X, commenting: \"James Comey causally [sic] calling for my dad to be murdered.\"Comey served as the FBI's director between 2013-17.He had a tumultuous tenure that included overseeing the high-profile inquiry into Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's email just weeks before the 2016 election that she ended up losing to Trump.He was fired by Trump amid an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weeklyUS Politics Unspunnewsletter.

    "title": "Trump's frantic week of peace brokering hints at what he really wants",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyv789ejgxo",
    "content": "\"There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.\" So supposedly said the Russian revolutionary leader Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. The diplomatic whirlwind that has surrounded US President Donald Trump this week suggests the old Bolshevik might have been onto something.For the protectionist president, who promises always to put America First, has in recent days instead been busy bestriding the world stage.He and his team have done business deals in the Gulf; lifted sanctions on Syria; negotiated the release of a US citizen held by Hamas; ended military strikes on Houthi fighters in Yemen; slashed American tariffs on China; ordered Ukraine to hold talks with Russia in Turkey; continued quiet negotiations with Iran over a nuclear deal; and even claimed responsibility for brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan...The pace has been breathless, leaving allies and opponents alike struggling to catch up as the US diplomatic bandwagon hurtled from issue to issue.\"Just, wow!\" remarked one London-based ambassador. \"It is almost impossible to stay on top of everything that's going on.\"So whatisgoing on? What have we learned in this frantic week about the US president's emerging foreign policy? Is there something approaching a Trump doctrine - or is this just a coincidental confluence of global events?\nA good place to start, perhaps, is the president's visit to the Gulf where he set out - in word and deed - his vision for a world of interstate relations based on trade, not war. In a speech in Riyadh, Trump said he wanted \"commerce not chaos\" in the Middle East, a region that \"exports technology not terrorism\".His was a prospect of a breezy, pragmatic mercantilism where nations did business deals to their mutual benefit, a world where profit can bring peace.\nAs he enjoyed the flattery of his Saudi hosts and the obeisance of visiting dignitaries, the president signed - with his fat felt tip pen - deals that the White House claimed represented $600bn of investment in the US.This was Trump in all his pomp; applauded and rewarded with immediate wins he could sell back home as good for American jobs.Some diplomats privately questioned the value of the various memorandums of understanding. But the show, they said, was more important than the substance.\nAbsent from Trump's speech was any mention of possible collective action by the US and other countries; no talk of multilateral cooperation against the threat of climate change, no concerns about challenges to democratic or human rights in the region. This was a discourse almost entirely without reference to ideology or values except to dismiss their significance.Rather, he used his speech to Saudi leaders to make his clearest argument yet against Western interventionism of the past, attacking what he called \"the so-called nation-builders and neo-cons\" for \"giving you lectures on how to live or how to govern your own affairs\".To the applause of his Arab audience, he said these \"Western interventionists\" had \"wrecked more nations than they built\", adding: \"Far too many American presidents have been afflicted with the notion that it's our job to look into the souls of foreign leaders and use US policy to dispense justice for their sins.\"I believe it's God's job to sit in judgement. My job is to defend America.\"\nThat reluctance to intervene was on show in recent days when it came to the fighting between India and Pakistan. In the past, the US has often played a key role seeking to end military confrontations in the subcontinent. But the Trump White House was initially cautious about getting involved.Vice-President JD Vance told Fox News the fighting was \"fundamentally none of our businessâ¦ We can't control these countries\".In the end, both he and Secretary of State Marco Rubio did make calls, putting pressure on both nuclear powers to de-escalate. So too did other countries.When the ceasefire was agreed, Trump claimed US diplomacy had brokered the deal. But that was flatly dismissed by Indian diplomats who insisted it was a bilateral truce.\nThe centrality of Trump to US foreign policy has also become apparent this week. This is more than just a simple truism. On show was the lack of involvement of other parts of the US government that traditionally help shape US decision-making overseas.Take the president's extraordinary decision to meet Syria's new president and former jihadist, Ahmed al-Sharaa, and lift sanctions on Syria. This showed the potential advantage of having foreign policy in one man's hands: it was a decisive and bold step. And it was clearly the president's personal decision, after heavy lobbying by both Turkey and Saudi Arabia.It was seen by some diplomats as the quid pro quo for the diplomatic fawning and investment deals Trump received in Riyadh. Not only did the decision surprise many in the region but it also surprised many in the American government.Diplomats said the State Department was reluctant to lift sanctions, wanting to keep some leverage over the new Syrian government, fearful it was not doing enough to protect minorities and tackle foreign fighters.Diplomats say this pattern of impulsive decision-making without wider internal government discussion is common in the White House. The result, they say, is not always positive.\nThis is due, in part, to Trump's lack of consistency (or put simply, changing his mind).Take the decision this week to do a deal with China to cut tariffs on trade with the US. A few weeks ago Trump imposed 145% tariffs on Beijing, with blood thirsty warnings against retaliation. The Chinese retaliated, the markets plunged, American businesses warned of dire consequences.So in Geneva, US officials climbed down and most tariffs against China were cut to 30%, supposedly in return for some increased US access to Chinese markets. This followed a now-familiar pattern: issue maximalist demands, threaten worse, negotiate, climb down and declare victory.\nThe problem is that this \"art of a deal\" strategy might work on easily reversible decisions such as tariffs. It is harder to apply to longer term diplomatic conundrums such as war.Take Russia's invasion of Ukraine. On this, Trump's policy has been fluid, to put it mildly. And this week was a case in point.Last Saturday the leaders of the UK, France, Poland and Germany visited Kyiv to put on a show of support for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. And in a group call with Trump on French President Emmanuel Macron's phone, they spelled out their strategy of demanding Russia agree an immediate 30-day ceasefire or face tougher sanctions.This was Trump's policy too. The day before he wrote on social media: \"If the ceasefire is not respected, the US and its partners will impose further sanctions.\" But then on Sunday, President Vladimir Putin suggested instead there should be direct talks between Ukraine and Russia in Turkey on Thursday. Trump immediately went along with this, backtracking on the strategy he had agreed with European leaders a day earlier.\n\"Ukraine should agree to (these talks) immediately,\" he wrote on social media. \"I am starting to doubt that Ukraine will make a deal with Putin.\"Then on Thursday, Trump changed his position again, saying a deal could be done only if he and Putin were to meet in person.This puzzles some diplomats. \"Does he genuinely not know what he wants to do about the war in Ukraine?\" one remarked to me. \"Or does he just grasp at what might offer the quickest resolution possible?\"\nInto this puzzling mix fell two other decisions this week. First, Trump agreed a ceasefire after a campaign bombing Houthi fighters in Yemen for almost two months. There have been questions about the effectiveness of the hugely expensive air strikes, and the president's appetite for a long military operation. He repeatedly told his Arab hosts how much he disliked war.Second, Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, held his fourth round of talks with Iran over efforts to curb their nuclear ambitions. Both sides are hinting that a deal is possible, although sceptics fear it could be quite modest. Talk of joint US-Israeli military action against Iran seems to have dissipated.\nWhat unites both issues is that the United States was acting directly against the wishes of Israel. Benjamin Netanyahu may have been the first world leader invited to the Oval Office after Trump's inauguration, but in recent days, he seems to have been snubbed. Trump toured the Middle East without visiting Israel; he lifted sanctions on Syria without Israel's support. His Houthi ceasefire came only days after the group attacked Tel Aviv airport.Diplomats fear Netanyahu's reaction. Could the spurned prime minister respond with a more aggressive military operation in Gaza?\nSo after this week of diplomatic hurly burly, how much has changed? Perhaps less than might appear.For all the glitz of Trump's tour through the Middle East, the fighting and humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues unresolved. A fresh Israeli offensive seems imminent. One of Trump's chief aims â the normalisation of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia - remains distant.For all the talks about ending the war in Ukraine, there is no greater likelihood of the guns falling silent. Putin's ambitions seem unchanged. And for all the deals to cut US tariffs, either with the UK or China, there is still huge global market instability.\nWe do have a clearer idea of Trump's global ideology, one that is not isolationist but mercantilist, hoping optimistically that capitalism can overcome conflict. We also have a clearer idea of his haste, his desire to clear his diplomatic decks â in the Middle East, Ukraine and the subcontinent â so he can focus on his primary concern, namely China.But that may prove an elusive ambition.â¯If there are weeks when decades happen, there are also weeks when nothing happens.\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepthis the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "title": "Of opium, fire temples, and sarees: A peek into the world of India's dwindling Parsis",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgv445jqr1o",
    "content": "Tucked away in a lane in the southern end of India's financial capital, Mumbai, is a  museum dedicated to the followers of one of the world's oldest religions, Zoroastrianism.The Framji Dadabhoy Alpaiwalla Museum documents the history and legacy of the ancient Parsi community - a small ethnic group that's fast dwindling and resides largely in India.Now estimated at just 50,000 to 60,000, the Parsis are believed to be descendants of Persians who fled religious persecution by Islamic rulers centuries ago.Despite their significant contributions to India's economic and cultural fabric, much about the Parsi community remains little known to the mainstream population and the wider world.\"The newly-renovated museum hopes to shake off some of this obscurity by inviting people to explore the history, culture and traditions of the Parsi community through the rare historical artefacts on display,\" says Kerman Fatakia, curator of the museum.\nSome of these include cuneiform bricks, terracotta pots, coins and other objects sourced from places like Babylon, Mesopotamia, Susa and Iran and are dated to 4000-5000 BCE.These are places where Zoroastrian Iranian kings once ruled, like the Achaemenian, Parthian and Sasanian dynasties.There are also artefacts from Yazd, a city in central Iran which was once a barren desert and the place where many Zoroastrians settled after fleeing other regions of Iran after the Arab invasion in 7th Century BCE.One of the notable artefacts on display is a replica of a clay cylinder of Cyrus the Great, a Persian king who was the founder of the Achaemenid empire.Fatakia says the clay cylinder - also known as the \"Edict of Cyrus\" or the \"Cyrus Cylinder\" - is one of the most important discoveries of the ancient world. Inscribed in cuneiform script, it outlines the rights granted by Cyrus to his subjects in Babylon. Widely seen as the first human rights charter, a replica is also displayed at the United Nations.Then there are maps that trace the migration routes of thousands of Iranian Zoroastrians who fled their home country fearing persecution and travelled to India in the 8th to10th centuries, and again in the 19th century.The collection also features furniture, manuscripts, paintings, and portraits of prominent Parsis - among them Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata, founder of the iconic Tata Group, which owns brands like Jaguar Land Rover and Tetley tea.Another striking section showcases artefacts collected by Parsis who grew wealthy in the early 19th century trading tea, silk, cotton - and notably, opium - with China. The exhibits include traditional Parsi sarees influenced by designs from China, France, and other regions shaped by these global trade ties.\nTwo of the museum's most compelling exhibits are replicas of a Tower of Silence and a Parsi fire temple.The Tower of Silence, or dakhma, is where Parsis leave their dead to be returned to nature - neither buried nor cremated. \"The replica shows exactly what happens to the body once it's placed there,\" says Fatakia, noting that entry to actual towers is restricted to a select few.The life-size replica of the fire temple is equally fascinating, offering a rare glimpse into a sacred space typically off-limits to non-Parsis. Modelled on a prominent Mumbai temple, it features sacred motifs inspired by ancient Persian architecture in Iran.\nThe Alpaiwala Museum, originally founded in 1952 in what was then Bombay, is one of the city's older institutions. Recently renovated, it now features modern displays with well-captioned exhibits in glass cases. Every visitor is offered a guided tour.\"It's a small museum but it is packed with history,\" Fatakia says.\"And it's a great place for not just the residents of Mumbai or India to learn more about the Parsi community but for people from all over the world.\""

    "title": "Polish voters set for tight presidential race after 10 years of Duda",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8zxn9xg2ro",
    "content": "When Poles vote for a new president on Sunday, they are expected to set up a second round run-off between Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski and national-conservative historian Karol Nawrocki.If opinion polls are correct, that would mean a 1 June contest between candidates backed by the two parties that have dominated Polish politics for the past two decades, a domination some voters say they're fed up with.Trzaskowski, the current front-runner, is deputy leader of prime minister Donald Tusk's centre-right Civic Platform (PO).Nawrocki, currently polling between 4%-6% behind, is supported by the Law and Justice (PiS) opposition party that lost power 18 months ago.Poland's president has the power to veto government bills, so what happens in this election is significant.Tusk's coalition does not have a big enough parliamentary majority to overturn that veto, which outgoing President Andrzej Duda, a former PiS member and ally, has used on several occasions.\nThat barrier may now fall as Duda cannot run again after serving two consecutive five-year terms.Observers outside Poland portrayed Tusk's election as prime minister in late 2023 as saving liberal democracy after eight years of right-wing authoritarian populism by the PiS-led government.Critics widely accused PiS of turning public media into crude propaganda for its conservative Catholic worldview, politicising the civil service and judiciary and punishing judges who dared to oppose the reform.But Tusk's coalition government has also used questionable legal methods to wrestle back control of the public media.Tusk has suspended the right for migrants arriving on the border with Belarus to apply for asylum and failed to deliver many of his campaign promises such as liberalising the country's strict abortion law.\"This is not the triumph of liberal values. It's a choice between a stupid and authoritarian right-wing populism and a hypocritical, and in my eyes, morally corrupt liberal populism,\" Konstanty Gebert, a columnist for Kultura Liberalna told the BBC.The presidential election could be won in Sunday's first round with more than 50% of the vote, but latest opinion polls suggest it will be decided on 1 June.\nMiroslaw Kaznowski, a member of the Green party that belongs to Tusk's broader Civic Coalition, will vote for Trzaskowski, despite some reservations.He told the BBC: \"I am disappointed the coalition government is pandering to the right-wing electorate instead of standing up for its values.\"In one of the presidential debates, the PiS-backed candidate Nawrocki, proudly brandishing a mini Polish flag, tried to embarrass Trzaskowski by handing him a small rainbow flag.In the past, the Warsaw mayor has been a vocal supporter of LGBTQ+ rights and attended equality marches in the capital.Trzaskowski took the flag and put it on the floor, causing left-wing candidate Magdalena Biejat to walk over, saying \"I'm not ashamed of it, I'll gladly take it from you\".Kaznowski said: \"Migration, LGBT+, women's rights and the environment have fallen off the agenda, but we're still at the risk of falling back to an authoritarian government that aspires to Eastern values.\"\nTusk promised Polish women legal abortion up to the 12th week of pregnancy, but he has not delivered on his promise.He presides over a broad coalition built around his own centre-right grouping that also includes smaller left-wing and conservative parties.Disagreements within the coalition over abortion and legalising same sex partnerships stalled even before President Duda had the chance to veto them.Following Russia's war in neighbouring Ukraine, state security has dominated political discourse.\nForeign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said \"outflanking\" PiS on security, including a tough migration policy, was key to winning the 2023 election.Hours before campaigning came to an end on Friday, Tusk accused a group of Russian hackers of attacking websites belonging to parties in the government. Tusk's Civic Platform site was unavailable along with that of a smaller agrarian conservative partner, the Polish People's Party.This year, Poland is planning to spend 4.7% of its GDP on defence, a larger proportion than any other Nato member.Tusk wants to offer all adult males the chance to do military training. Trzaskowski was photographed going through basic drills during the campaign.\nThe liberal mayor's tough messages on security and migration led PiS to accuse him of saying anything to win votes.It's a view shared by civil servant Wojciech Karlik, who plans to vote for the PiS-backed candidate, Nawrocki.\"Nawrocki will fight for Poland's interests in the EU. He's reliable unlike Trzaskowski who keeps changing his mind on issues like migration,\" he said.Nawrocki has come under fire recently over accusations, which he denies, that he bought a council flat from a senior citizen in poor health at a 90% discount to the market price in return for promises of assistance and care.By his team's own admission, Nawrocki was surprised when he lost contact with the pensioner last December. Local media reported the man had been living in a nursing home paid for by taxpayers for six months by that stage.Following an uproar, Nawrocki said he would donate the flat to charity. Opinion polls suggest the accusations have not damaged Nawrocki's chances so far.But the numbers indicate none of the 13 candidates will win sufficient votes to avoid a run-off between the two front-runners.PiS, led by 75-year-old Jaroslaw Kaczynski, and Tusk's PO are the two parties that have dominated Polish politics for the last 20 years and some voters are fed up with the duopoly.In March, 38-year-old far-right libertarian candidate and brewing entrepreneur Slawomir Mentzen, who attracted voters, especially young men, with his anti-migrant and tax-cutting talks during his \"Beer with Mentzen\" meetings in small towns and cities, appeared close to overtaking Nawrocki into second place.But his support has dropped since he gave an interview calling for the introduction of student tuition fees and a ban on abortion even in cases of rape.Aleksandra Januszewicz, a psychotherapist, told the BBC: \"I'm fed up with the stranglehold of PO and PiS. The politics I'm seeing is mostly a form of populism that plays to voters' emotions.\"I'm not decided yet [on who to vote for], but I'm going to throw up afterwards.\"Human rights lawyer Malgorzata Szuleka agrees there is fatigue, both with the duopoly and Tusk government's failure to deliver.\"Polish politics looks a little bit like going to McDonalds,\" she told the BBC. \"You go in hoping for something else and you leave with a burger and fries.\"My hope is for a president that can freeze the polarisation in the country, and we can start talking to each other again.\""

    "title": "Is Britain really inching back towards the EU?",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20x395pvvjo",
    "content": "Listen to Damian read this articleOn a warm morning earlier this month, a group of Metropolitan Police diplomatic protection officers sat in an anteroom off the ornate entrance hall in London's Lancaster House, sipping tea and nibbling chocolate biscuits, while upstairs a core group of European politicians discussed the future of European cooperation.It was an apt setting: everywhere you look in Lancaster House, there is evidence of the long, entangled histories of the UK and Europe. The double sweep of its grand staircase deliberately echoes the Palace of Versailles. Queen Victoria sat in these rooms listening to Frederic Chopin play the piano in 1848. Tony Blair hosted Russian President Putin here for an energy summit in 2003.The important issues on the agenda at the Lancaster House meeting, which was hosted by the Foreign Secretary David Lammy, included the latest developments in the war in Ukraine, Europe's response to ensure the continent's security, and â for the first time since Brexit â a summit between the UK and the European Union, which will take place on 19 May.The British government believes it's a significant moment.\nBefore Brexit, British prime ministers would travel to Brussels four times a year or more for summits with the heads of the EU's institutions and its 27 member states. The haggling would go on late into the night. After Brexit those large summits stopped.Now, the Labour government, elected last year on a manifesto that promised \"an improved and ambitious relationship with our European partners\", envisages new and regular interactions with the EU. Monday's marks the first.Sir Keir Starmer will host the most senior EU leaders to launch a new \"partnership\".Pedro Serrano, the EU ambassador to London, has described it as the \"culmination of enhanced contacts at the highest levels since the July 2024 [UK] elections\". But what will it amount to?Is what's coming a \"surrender summit\" as the Conservatives warn; \"the great British sellout\" undoing bits of Brexit that Reform UK fear; or \"a huge opportunity\" the UK may be about to squander, as Liberal Democrats say? Or could it be an example of how, in Sir Keir Starmer's words, \"serious pragmatism defeats performative politics\" by delivering practical things that will improve people's lives?\nIn those long, drama-filled nights of 2020, when the then-prime minister Boris Johnson was negotiating Brexit, the possibility of a Security and Defence Partnership was discussed. But the UK's main priority was diverging from Brussels. So nothing was agreed â a notable omission, some think.Now a new UK-EU security pact has been worked on for months, the plan is for it to be the centrepiece of what's agreed.\nKaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, who is overseeing negotiations, was at the early talks at Lancaster House. \"Our relationship has had some difficulties,\" she told me, but \"considering what is going on in the world [â¦] we need to move forward with this partnership.\"Yet some think the UK should not seize this outstretched hand.\"The cornerstone of our defence is Nato,\" Alex Burghart, a Conservative frontbencher, told the Commons this week. \"We know of no reason why Nato is insufficient.\"Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice has his own view. \"There's no value at all,\" he argues. \"We do not want to be constrained by a bungling top-down bureaucratic military structure. Our defence is guaranteed by Nato.\"The government fires back on that point, arguing that a partnership will in no way undermine Nato; rather it will complement it, they say, because it will stretch to areas beyond defence, like the security of our economies, infrastructure, energy supplies, even migration and transnational crime.Some industry experts also believe that a security pact could boost the UK economy. Kevin Craven, chief executive of ADS Group, a UK trade association that represents aerospace, defence and security firms, is among them.Take, for example, the SAFE (Security Action For Europe) programme that is being set up by the EU, aiming to provide up to â¬150bn (Â£126bn) in loans for new projects. If the UK strikes a security partnership with the EU, then British weapons manufacturers could potentially access some of that cash.\"There is a huge amount of interest from European partners,\" says Mr Craven. \"One of the challenges for defence companies in the last couple of years, since the advent of Ukraine, is being able to scale up their own capacity to meet demand.\" He estimates the UK could boost the EU's defence output by a fifth.\nThe Liberal Democrat's Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Calum Miller, similarly believes that a security pact is a huge opportunity for the British defence industry - but, he adds, \"as importantly, it's a new strategic opportunity for the UK to be part of that ongoing conversation about how we arm as a continent\".Others point out that the UK has already been working with the EU on defence ever since Russia's invasion of Ukraine â at Nato, and most recently via the so-called Coalition of the Willing.So, in practice, does it make huge amounts of difference to the UK's place in Europe?No, argues Jill Rutter, a former senior civil servant who is now a senior fellow at the UK in a Changing Europe think tank. \"Because relations [on defence] have already been improving quite a long way.\"Some of those working on the partnership, however, argue that it will set in train new ways for the UK to engage and cooperate with its neighbours.\nMore contentious is the UK's desire to sign what's called a 'veterinary' deal to remove some border checks on food and drink. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister leading these negotiations, told the Commons this week that the objective to lower food and drink costs is in the manifesto, so there is a mandate for it.Inside the food industry, calls for reform have been growing. Julianne Ponan, whose firm Creative Nature makes vegan snack bars, exports to 18 countries but only a small proportion goes to the EU. She says this is because of the paperwork and inspections since Brexit.One of her employees had to carry samples in her luggage on a passenger flight to Spain for a meeting to make sure the food wasn't held up at the border, she says.\"I think this will open up huge opportunities for businesses like mine.\"\nIt would also make a big difference for Northern Ireland. After Brexit, special arrangements were put in place to keep the land border it shares with the Republic of Ireland free of new impediments. But at the same time, new paperwork and inspections were put in place on food, drink, animals and plants being transported from mainland Britain across the Irish Sea to Northern Ireland. They're bitterly opposed by Unionist politicians and complicate life for many businesses.But a veterinary deal may carry political danger. It would require the UK to align some of its rules on food and drink with EU ones, and move in-step with Brussels over time. And those rules are subject to oversight by EU courts.\"I call it the surrender summit,\" says Andrew Griffith, the Conservative Shadow Business and Trade Secretary. Under this deal the UK would lose \"our freedom to set our own rules\", he adds.The Conservatives say they \"fought long and hard\" to \"take back control of our laws, our borders, our money\" â and that this should not now be reversed.\nReform UK has not held back in its language: \"We think prepare for the Great British sell out. That's the bottom line, and it will be dressed up as a reset,\" Richard Tice says.\"Why would you want to reset and get closer to a patently failing economic model? The EU is struggling even more than we are. We should be diverging as fast as we can away from that.\"But Labour's Thomas-Symonds dismisses these views as a \"rehash of the arguments of the past\".On the other end of the spectrum is the accusation that Sir Keir is far too cautious. Calum Miller of the Liberal Democrats says he knows of businesses \"gnashing their teeth in frustration that they just can't exploit opportunities to work with and trade with Europe\".\nHis party wants the UK to explore a Customs Union with the EU. It would make moving goods easier, but mean we couldn't sign our own trade deals.David Henig, a former senior trade negotiator, has been talking to both sides \"hoping to help, to sort of navigate them in\".\"The summit is a step forward, not a step change,\" he says, \"A slight deepening of the trade ties, rather than something dramatically new.\"A deal on food and drink checks would deliver very little, he believes, because food and drink is such a limited part of trade. \"If you were, for example, aligning UK and EU rules on industrial products, you'd get a much bigger economic impact\".Jill Rutter thinks that a veterinary deal would not prove \"economically earth shattering\" â but if it goes well, she argues that it could provide \"early proof of concept\" for further UK-EU cooperation.\nAfter Brexit, many British fishermen were disappointed when Boris Johnson's government agreed to let EU boats continue much as before, taking significant catches from UK waters. Those arrangements expire next year. The EU wants them extended.David Davis who, as Brexit minister, led some of the original negotiations for the UK, told me fishing was \"totemic\" for Brussels. London conceded too easily, he thinks.\"Europeans got what they wanted first, and then we had a haggle from a weak position.\"\nSo he adds, \"If I was giving advice to the government, I would say, tough it out\" and use fishing as a lever to seek concessions.But, as the UK found before, Brussels has cards to play. Much of the fish caught by British fishermen is sold to buyers on the Continent and the UK needs access to that market.Some EU coastal states, like France and Denmark, are prepared to drive a hard bargain, demanding that London concedes on fishing rights in return for things it wants. Early on, even signing the Security Partnership was being linked to agreement on a fishing deal. The haggling will be tough.\nAnd finally, there's an idea that has prompted much interest in recent months: a youth mobility deal, through which under-30s from the UK and EU could live and work in each other's countries.For a long time the government said there were \"no plans\" for such a deal â but earlier this month they changed course, with Labour's Thomas-Symonds saying that \"A smart, controlled youth mobility scheme would of course have benefits for our young people\".It's likely that would mean very limited numbers allowed to enter the UK, and only with a visa, for a limited time.Under those conditions, ministers hope it would not inflate net migration numbers. It's far from what the EU would like.The UK already has similar schemes with 13 countries, including Australia, New Zealand and Japan.\"When we are comfortable having those relationships, why are we so averse to having it with our nearest neighbours?\" Calum Miller asks, \"It just doesn't really make sense\".\nPaula Surridge, a professor of political sociology at Bristol University, argues that public views on immigration are more nuanced than many people think. \"Voters care most about what they perceive as illegal migration â small boat crossings and so on,\" she says, \"People coming here to study or to work, particularly young people, are not a particular cause for concern\" for most.\"There will definitely be a group of voters that are upset [about potential deals], but they were never going to vote Labour.\"Of those who backed Labour in 2024, she adds, about three quarters previously voted Remain in the Brexit referendum. The political risk to the government of signing pacts with the EU is \"smaller than it appears\", she adds.Conservative pollster Lord Hayward is more cautious â and is concerned that a deal may pose a \"bear trap\" for the government if it's seen as providing free movement to young Europeans. \"It will provide serious difficulties for them to come to an agreement on something which could easily be portrayed as EU membership 2.0.\"\nEven before Sir Keir's upcoming summit on Monday, his opponents are raising that spectre.\"All of his muscle memory has been to get closer to the European political union,\" says Mr Griffith. \"I am worried about our prime minister, with that baggage, with those preconceived ideas, [â¦] trying to negotiate a better deal with the EU.\"Richard Tice says his party could simply undo any deals with the EU. \"If I'm right about our fears, and we win the next general election, we will just reverse the lot. The whole lot.\"\nBut Mr Thomas-Symonds is of the view that Monday will show the government is \"not returning to the Customs Union, Single Market, or Freedom of Movement\", all red lines it has pledged not to cross.Instead it will be about \"making Brexit work in the interests of the British people\".\nBack at Lancaster House, the politicians have moved on, heading to more meetings in Albania and Turkey to grapple with the issues facing the continent. But in a quiet hallway in the house is a painting from the 1850s of the Duke of Wellington inspecting troops in London's Hyde Park.In it, he sits on a black stallion, raising his white-feathered hat to salute the cavalry - a tribute to the prime minister and military hero who defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo.The upcoming summit won't be as momentous an event in the UK's complicated history with Europe. But a modern British leader about to plunge into the fray of European politics might pause for thought here â perhaps, for just a moment.\nBBC InDepthis the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "title": "'I didn't come here for fun' - Afrikaner defends refugee status in US",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98p3eple9eo",
    "content": "Last week, 46-year-old Charl Kleinhaus was living on his family farm in Mpumalanga province, South Africa. With its scenic beauty, wildlife and deep canyons, it's known as \"the place where the sun rises\".His new home - for now - is a budget hotel near an American highway.He and dozens of other white South Africans were moved to the US under President Donald Trump's controversial policy to protect them from the discrimination he alleges they are facing - an accusation that South Africa rejects.Mr Kleinhaus defends the US president, telling the BBC he left his homeland after receiving death threats in WhatsApp messages.\"I had to leave a five-bedroom house, which I will lose now,\" Mr Kleinhaus tells the BBC, adding that he also left behind his car, his dogs and even his mother. \"I didn't come here for fun,\" he adds.The contrast in homes couldn't be more stark. But for Mr Kleinhaus, his situation in Buffalo, New York, is already a better one. \"My children are safe,\" says Mr Kleinhaus, whose wife died in a road accident in 2006.The status of white South African farmers has long been a rallying cry on the right and far-right of American politics.Trump and his close ally, South Africa-born billionaire Elon Musk, have even argued that there has been a \"genocide\" of white farmers in South Africa - a claim that has been widely discredited.In February, Trump signed an executive order granting refugee status to Afrikaners, such as Mr Kleinhaus, who he said were being persecuted.Mr Kleinhaus is one of a group of 59 who arrived on Tuesday at Dulles airport, near Washington DC, after Trump's administration fast-tracked their applications.He admits he was surprised at how quickly he got to the US, and that he is grateful to Trump. \"I felt finally somebody in this world is seeing what's going on,\" he says.As he and his family arrived with others at the airport they were greeted with red, white and blue balloons. He describes the pomp and ceremony as \"overwhelming\".\nDo Afrikaners want to take Trump up on his refugee offer?Is there a genocide of white South Africans as Trump claims?\nAfrikaners are a white ethnic minority who ran South Africa during the apartheid era, implementing racist policies of segregation in the country until the regime was officially abolished in 1994.But more than 30 years on, black farmers own only a small fraction of the country's best farmland, with the majority still in white hands.That has led to anger over the slow pace of change. Mr Kleinhaus acknowledges that black South Africans have suffered as well as him.But he says: \"I had nothing to do with apartheid. Nothing, nothing, nothing.\"In January, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa signed a controversial law allowing the government to seize privately owned land without compensation - in certain circumstances, when it is deemed \"equitable and in the public interest\".The South African government says no land has yet been seized. But Mr Kleinhaus says once there is a government claim on your land - as he says is the case with his - it becomes impossible to function.\"Your land becomes worthless - the land expropriation has gone too far,\" he says. \"People are scared of that. Other Afrikaners who criticise us live in a bubble.\"Some fellow Afrikaners have described Mr Kleinhaus and the group as opportunists, and that being a victim of crime is not equivalent to the type of persecution that deserves refugee status.Mr Kleinhaus acknowledges that the murder rate of farmers is low in South Africa, but says he does not want to be a victim. \"There are people in my area who were shot and killed,\" he says.He says he received threats from members of the local community: \"I'd regularly get messages on WhatsApp saying, 'we'll get rid of you, you're on my land'.\"Mr Kleinhaus says he received one message before he left for the US which read: \"We are coming for you, you better be awake.\"He also says his farming machinery was damaged, and that local police failed to act on his reports.\nClaims of white genocide 'not real', South African court rulesWhite South Africans going to US are cowards, Ramaphosa says\nRamaphosa has called the group who travelled to the US \"cowards\", saying they do not want to address the inequities of the apartheid era.\"As South Africans, we are resilient,\" he said earlier this week. \"We don't run away from our problems. We must stay here and solve our problems.\"What makes the resettlement of the Afrikaners to the US particularly controversial is that other refugees have been banned, including Afghans who earlier this week had their Temporary Protected Status removed.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said that move was justified because the security and economic situation in Afghanistan had improved - despite criticism from opposition lawmakers and rights groups.Mr Kleinhaus says he is sympathetic: \"I mean, I feel sorry for the Afghans that they can't get here. But I know there's a process there. And I know when and if you are approved for the process, they take care of you.\"Does he worry he's being used as a political pawn by Trump? And that another president could potentially reverse this decision in four years' time?Mr Kleinhaus pauses, and says: \"Yeah, it is scary, but I am a religious person. Just to be in this first group is an act of God, I believe, because there was a 0.0 something percent chance that you were selected for the first call.\"\nMr Kleinhaus has come under scrutiny for antisemitic posts on social media, which have since been deleted.Discussing one of these, he says he copied and pasted someone else's thoughts, and  that he was being administered morphine as part of medical treatment at the time - though he admits this was not an excuse.The 2023 post was made in a moment of anger, he adds, after he saw a video - not verified by the BBC - which purported to show some Jews spitting at Christians in Israel.Mr Kleinhaus insists the comments were specific to one moment, and not a wider comment about Jewish people. \"Even now, if I see any person going against my religion, I will speak up against it,\" he said.The US government is facing questions about the vetting process for those being resettled. The UN's refugee agency told the BBC it was not involved in the screening process for the Afrikaners as it normally would be for refugees heading to the US.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has previously stated it is screening immigrants' social media activity for antisemitism, and using it as a reason for denying applicants.The Trump administration has been citing allegations of antisemitism as its officials have in recent months arrested and tried to deport pro-Palestinian activists.In a statement to the BBC, a senior DHS official said: \"The Department of Homeland Security vets all refugee applicants. Any claims of misconduct are thoroughly investigated, and appropriate action will be taken as necessary. DHS does not comment on individual application status.\"Since returning to office, Trump has launched a crackdown to reduce immigration more broadly. So, is Mr Kleinhaus concerned about any backlash to his group being offered entry to the US?\"People must not think we are just taking advantage of this,\" he says. \"We come here to make a contribution to the country.\"I'm not worried it'll fall apart because I believe this is God's plan for me.\"My life is in his hands. And if if he didn't want me to come, I wouldn't be here.\""

    "title": "Is there a genocide of white South Africans as Trump claims?",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wg5pg1xp5o",
    "content": "US President Donald Trump has given members of South Africa's Afrikaner community refugee status, alleging that a genocide was taking place in the country.Nearly 60 of them have arrived in the US after being granted asylum.The South African government allowed the US embassy to consider their applications inside the country, and let the group board a chartered flight from the main international airport in Johannesburg - not scenes normally associated with refugees fleeing persecution.\nSouth African History Online sums up their identity by pointing out that \"the modern Afrikaner is descended mainly from Western Europeans who settled on the southern tip of Africa during the middle of the 17th Century\".A mixture of Dutch (34.8%), German (33.7%) and French (13.2%) settlers, they formed a \"unique cultural group\" which identified itself \"completely with African soil\",South African History Online noted.Their language, Afrikaans, is quite similar to Dutch.But as they planted their roots in Africa, Afrikaners, as well as other white communities, forced black people to leave their land.Afrikaners are also known as Boers, which actually means farmer, and the group is still closely associated with farming.In 1948, South Africa's Afrikaner-led government introduced apartheid, or apartness, taking racial segregation to a more extreme level.This included laws which banned marriages across racial lines, reserved many skilled and semi-skilled jobs for white people, and forced black people to live in what were called townships and homelands.They were also denied a decent education, with Afrikaner leader Hendrik Verwoerd infamously remarking in the 1950s that \"blacks should never be shown the greener pastures of education. They should know their station in life is to be hewers of wood and drawers of water\".Afrikaner dominance of South Africa ended in 1994, when black people were allowed to vote for the first time in a nationwide election, bringing Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress (ANC) to power.Afrikaners currently number more than 2.5 million out of a population of more than 60 million - about 4%.\nNone of South Africa's political parties - including those that represent Afrikaners and the white community in general - have claimed that there is a genocide in South Africa.But such claims have been circulating among right-wing groups for many years and Trump also referred to a genocide during his first term.The claims stem from attacks on white farmers, or misleading information circulated online.In February, a South African judgedismissed the idea of a genocideas \"clearly imagined\" and \"not real\", when ruling in an inheritance case involving a wealthy benefactor's donation to white supremacist group Boerelegioen.South Africa does not release crime figures based on race but the latest figures revealed that 6,953 people were murdered in the country between October and December 2024.Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks. Of the 12, one was a farmer, while five were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black.\nDefending his decision to give Afrikaners refugee status, Trump said that a \"genocide\" was taking place in South Africa, white farmers were being \"brutally killed\" and their \"land is being confiscated\".Trump said that he was not sure how he could attend the G20 summit of world leaders, due to be held in South Africa later this year, in such an environment.\"I don't know how we can go unless that situation's taken care of,\" he added.South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has said it was \"completely false\" to claim that \"people of a certain race or culture are being targeted for persecution\".Referring to the first group who have moved to the US, he said: \"They are leaving because they don't want to embrace the changes that are taking place in our country and our constitution.\"The government denies that land is being confiscated from farmers, saying that a billRamaphosa signed into law in Januarywas aimed at addressing the land dispossession that black people faced during white-minority rule.But the law has been condemned by the Democratic Alliance (DA), Ramaphosa's main coalition partner in government. The DA say it will challenge the law in South Africa's highest court, as it threatens property rights.Trump's close adviser Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa, has referred to the country's \"racist ownership laws\", alleging that his satellite internet service provider Starlink was \"not allowed to operate in South Africa simply because I'm not black\".To operate in South Africa, Starlink needs to obtain network and service licences, which both require 30% ownership by historically disadvantaged groups.This mainly refers to South Africa's majority black population, which was shut out of the economy during the racist system of apartheid.The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) - a regulatory body in the telecommunications and broadcasting sectors - told the BBC that Starlink had never submitted an application for a licence.Musk has also accused the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), the fourth-largest party in South Africa, of \"actively promoting\" a genocide through a song it sings at its rallies.Racially charged row between Musk and South Africa over Starlink\nEFF leader Julius Malema's trademark song is \"Shoot the Boer, Shoot the farmer\", which he sings at political rallies.Afrikaner lobby groups have tried to get the song banned, saying it was highly inflammatory and amounted to hate speech.However, South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal has ruled that Malema is within his rights to sing the lyrics - first popularised during the anti-apartheid struggle - at political rallies.The court ruled that a \"reasonably well-informed person\" would understand that when \"protest songs are sung, even by politicians, the words are not meant to be understood literally, nor is the gesture of shooting to be understood as a call to arms or violence\".Instead, the song was a \"provocative way\" of advancing the EFF's political agenda - which was to end \"land and economic injustice\".Lobby group AfriForum filed an appeal against the ruling, but South Africa's highest court refused to hear the case, saying it had little chance of succeeding.In 2023, South Africa's former President Thabo Mbeki urged Malema to stop singing the song, saying it was no longer politically relevant as the anti-apartheid struggle was over.The ANC says it no longer sings it, but it cannot \"prescribe to other political parties what they must sing\".\nEven though white-minority rule ended in 1994, its effects are still being felt.Average living standards are far higher for the white community than black people.White people occupy 62.1% of top management posts, despite only accounting for 7.7% of the country's economically active population, according to a recent report by South Africa's Commission for Employment Equity.The government has tried to change this through what it calls \"economic empowerment\" and \"employment equity\" laws.An amended version of the second act includes strict targets for companies aimed at increasing the number of non-white employees.While these laws has been welcomed by many South Africans, some members of racial minorities feel they make it harder for them to get jobs and government contracts. There has also been criticism that they can lead to corruption, for example when business opportunities are given to friends and relatives of officials.Among the critics have been the Democratic Alliance, which despite being part of the governing coalition, recently challenged the amended Employment Equity Act in court, saying it would \"make far more people marginalised in our economy than they already are\".Sports Minister Gayton McKenzie recently came under fire when a job in his department was advertised as being only open to the Coloured, Asian and white populations.He defended this move, saying he was applying the Employment Equity Act and ensuring \"all races are represented\", because most of the people in his department were black.\nIt doesn't look like it.In March, a business group said that close to 70,000 Afrikaners had expressed interest in moving to the US following Trump's offer - from an estimated population of 2.5 million.On Monday, the US embassy in South Africa released a statement clarifying the criteria for resettlement, saying it covered people from any racial minority, not just Afrikaners,who could cite an incident of past persecution or fear of persecution in the future.South Africa's most recent census, done in 2022, shows that Coloureds, (an officially used term meaning people of mixed racial origin) are the largest minority, making up 8% of the population. They are followed by white people, including Afrikaners, at 7%, and Asians at 3%.After Trump's offer, Afrikaner lobby group Solidarity posted an article on its website headlined: \"Ten historical reasons to stay in South Africa\".In parliament last week, the leader of the right-wing Freedom Front Plus party said they were committed to South Africa.\"We are bound to Africa and will build a future for ourselves and our children here,\" CornÃ© Mulder said.Additional report by Khanyisile Ngcobo in Johannesburg\nDo Afrikaners want to take Trump up on his South African refugee offer?PODCAST: Are white Afrikaners really being targeted in South Africa?What's really driving Trump's fury with South Africa?\nGo toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter@BBCAfrica, on Facebook atBBC Africaor on Instagram atbbcafrica"

    "title": "How India and Pakistan share one of the world's most dangerous borders",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmj7l0lne3o",
    "content": "To live along the Line of Control (LoC) - the volatile de facto border that separates India and Pakistan - is to exist perpetually on the razor's edge between fragile peace and open conflict.The recentescalationafter thePahalgam attackbrought India and Pakistan to the brink once again. Shells rained down on both sides of the LoC, turning homes to rubble and lives into statistics. At least 16 people were reportedly killed on the Indian side, while Pakistan claims 40 civilian deaths, though it remains unclear how many were directly caused by the shelling.\"Families on the LoC are subjected to Indian and Pakistani whims and face the brunt of heated tensions,\" Anam Zakaria, a Pakistani writer based in Canada, told the BBC.\"Each time firing resumes many are thrust into bunkers, livestock and livelihood is lost, infrastructure - homes, hospitals, schools - is damaged. The vulnerability and volatility experienced has grave repercussions for their everyday lived reality,\" Ms Zakaria, author of a book on Pakistan-administered Kashmir, said.India and Pakistan share a 3,323km (2,064-mile) border, including the 740km-long LoC; and the International Border (IB), spanning roughly 2,400km. The LoC began as the Ceasefire Line in 1949 after the first India-Pakistan war, and was renamed under the 1972Simla Agreement.The LoC cutting through Kashmir - claimed in full and administered in parts by both India and Pakistan - remains one of the most militarised borders in the world. Conflict is never far behind and ceasefires are only as durable as the next provocation.Ceasefire violations here can range from \"low-level firing to major land grabbing tosurgical strikes\", says Happymon Jacob, a foreign policy expert at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). (A land grab could involve seizing key positions such as hilltops, outposts, or buffer zones by force.)The LoC, many experts say, is a classic example of a \"border drawn in blood, forged through conflict\". It is also a line, as Ms Zakaria says, \"carved by India and Pakistan, and militarised and weaponised, without taking Kashmiris into account\".\nSuch wartime borders aren't unique to South Asia. Sumantra Bose, professor of international and comparative politics at Krea University in India and author of Kashmir at the Crossroads: Inside a 21st-Century Conflict, says the  most well-known is the'Green Line'- the ceasefire line of 1949 - which is the generally recognised boundary between Israel and the West Bank.Not surprisingly, the tentative calm along the LoC that had endured since the 2021 ceasefire agreement between the two nuclear-armed neighbours crumbled easily after the latest hostilities.\"The current escalation on the LoC and International Border (IB) is significant as it follows a four-year period of relative peace on the border,\" Surya Valliappan Krishna of Carnegie India told the BBC.Violence along the India-Pakistan border is not new - prior to the 2003 ceasefire, India reported 4,134 violations in 2001 and 5,767 in 2002.The 2003 ceasefire initially held, with negligible violations from 2004 to 2007, but tensions resurfaced in 2008 and escalated sharply by 2013.Between 2013 and early 2021, the LoC and the IB witnessed sustained high levels of conflict. A renewed ceasefire in February 2021 led to an immediate and sustained drop in violations through to March 2025.\"During periods of intense cross-border firing we've seen border populations in the many thousands be displaced for months on end,\" says Mr Krishna. Between late September and early December 2016, more than 27,000 people were displaced from border areas due to ceasefire violations and cross-border firing.\nIt's looking increasingly hairy and uncertain now.Tensions flared after the Pahalgam attack, with India suspending the key water-sharing treaty between India and Pakistan, known as theIndus Waters Treaty(IWT). Pakistan responded by threatening to exit the 1972 Simla Agreement, which formalised the LoC - though it hasn't followed through yet.\"This is significant because the Simla Agreement is the basis of the current LoC, which both sides agreed to not alter unilaterally in spite of their political differences,\" says Mr Krishna.Mr Jacob says for some \"curious reason\", ceasefire violations along the LoC have been absent from discussions and debates about escalation of conflict between the two countries.\"It is itself puzzling how the regular use of high-calibre weapons such as 105mm mortars, 130 and 155mm artillery guns and anti-tank guided missiles by two nuclear-capable countries, which has led to civilian and military casualties, has escaped scholarly scrutiny and policy attention,\" Mr Jacob writes in his book, Line On Fire: Ceasefire Violations and India-Pakistan Escalation Dynamics.Mr Jacob identifies two main triggers for the violations: Pakistan often uses cover fire to facilitate militant infiltration into Indian-administered Kashmir, which has witnessed an armed insurgency against Indian rule for over three decades. Pakistan, in turn, accuses India of unprovoked firing on civilian areas.He argues that ceasefire violations along the India-Pakistan border are less the product of high-level political strategy and more the result of local military dynamics.The hostilities are often initiated by field commanders - sometimes with, but often without, central approval. He also challenges the notion that the Pakistan Army alone drives the violations, pointing instead to a complex mix of local military imperatives and autonomy granted to border forces on both sides.Some experts believe It's time to revisit an idea shelved nearly two decades ago: turning the LoC into a formal, internationally recognised border. Others insist that possibility was never realistic - and still isn't.\n\"The idea is completely infeasible, a dead end. For decades, Indian maps have shown the entire territory of the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir as part of India,\" Sumantra Bose told the BBC.\"For Pakistan, making the LoC part of the International Border would mean settling the Kashmir dispute - which is Pakistan's equivalent of the Holy Grail - on India's preferred terms. Every Pakistani government and leader, civilian or military, over the past seven decades has rejected this.\"In his 2003 book, Kashmir: Roots of Conflict, Paths to Peace, Prof Bose writes: \"A Kashmir settlement necessitates that the LoC be transformed - from an iron curtain of barbed wire, bunkers, trenches and hostile militaries to a linen curtain. Realpolitik dictates that the border will be permanent (albeit probably under a different name), but it must be transcended without being abolished.\"\"I stressed, though, that such a transformation of the LoC must be embedded in a broader Kashmir settlement, as one pillar of a multi-pillared settlement,\" he told the BBC.Between 2004 and 2007, turning the LoC into a soft border was central to a fledgling India-Pakistan peace process on Kashmir - a process that ultimately fell apart.Today, the border has reignited, bringing back the cycle of violence and uncertainty for those who live in its shadow.\"You never know what will happen next. No one wants to sleep facing the Line of Control tonight,\" an employee of a hotel in Pakistan-administered Kashmir told BBC Urdu during the recent hostilities.It was a quiet reminder of how fragile peace is when your window opens to a battlefield."

    "title": "Valeria Marquez: Who was the Mexican influencer killed live on TikTok?",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly3nw938deo",
    "content": "When a 23-year-old Mexican influencer was shot dead while live streaming on TikTok, rumours began to swirl. Was it a cartel hit? Or another tragic example of violence against women?On Tuesday, Valeria Marquez was shot dead at Blossom The Beauty Lounge, a beauty salon owned by the victim in Zapopan, a town in the central-eastern state of Jalisco.The state prosecutor's office said it is investigating the crime as a femicide, meaning that it believes the crime was motivated by the fact the victim was a woman.The president of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, said an investigation is under way: \"We're working to catch those responsible and find out why this happened.\"But the fact that the crime took place in Jalisco, the state where the feared Cartel Jalisco Nueva GeneraciÃ³n (CJNG) emerged, led to speculation by some that the cartel may somehow be involved.\nMs Marquez was a Mexican model who began to make a name for herself in 2021 after winning the Miss Rostro (Miss Face) beauty pageant, according to Mexican media reports.Shortly thereafter, she began creating content on social media. She would share makeup tips and personal care routines, talk about fashion and show off her travels.Photos of her on private jets and yachts can be seen on her Instagram account, which had more than 223,000 followers at the time of her death.Ms Marquez also had another 100,000 followers on TikTok.Although it is unclear exactly what happened, during her final livestream, Ms Marquez said she was waiting for a courier she knew to deliver a gift.She added that she was a bit worried, because her friend could not see the courier's face when he arrived.\"Why didn't he just drop it off (the gift)? Were they going to pick me up (kidnap me) or what?\" she wondered aloud to her followers.While holding a pink stuffed animal, Ms Marquez looked away from the camera and immediately grabbed her chest and belly before collapsing into her chair.Another woman then took the phone and ended the livestream.Police arrived at the scene around 18:30 local time (12:30 GMT) and confirmed Ms Marquez's death, according to the state prosecutor.Authorities say that at least two men on motorcycles arrived at the salon and one of them asked the victim if she was Valeria. When she replied \"yes,\" he pulled out a gun and shot her at least twice before fleeing.Investigators say they are checking CCTV footage and tracking Ms Marquez's social media accounts for clues as to who the attackers might be.Mexican beauty influencer shot dead during TikTok livestream\nBut the salon's location in the wealthy Zapopan area of Guadalajara has raised questions about the motive for the crime. While the presence of private security and the tidyness of its streets give the impression that Zapopan is a safe area, in reality it is one of the most violent municipalities in Jalisco. In fact, shootings regularly occur in the area's luxurious shopping centres.More than half of the real estate and commercial development in the area is connected to the laundering of drug trafficking money, according to the US Department of Justice.Jalisco ranks sixth among Mexico's 32 states, including Mexico City, in terms of homicides, with 906 murders registered since the beginning of President Claudia Sheinbaum's term in October 2024, according to data consulting firm TResearch.It is also one of the Mexican states most affected by the cartels. It was here, 50 kilometres from Zapopan, that a cartel training centre was found in March, and it is here that 15,000 people have disappeared since 2018.The same day that MÃ¡rquez was killed, a former congressman named Luis Armando CÃ³rdoba DÃ­az was murdered just two kilometres away, according to the newspaperReforma.According to the state of Jalisco, as many as 90% of crimes are never reported or investigated. The state attorney's office has also long been accused of having links to cartels, which it denies.The prosecutor's office said that so far they have no reason to suspect that Ms Marquez's murder was ordered or carried out by any of the organised criminal groups operating in the area.Instead, the office suggested the murderer may have been motivated to kill her because of her gender.Mexican media outlets had previously published messages in which Ms Marquez blamed her ex-partner if anything happened to her.Mayor of Zapopan Juan JosÃ© Frangie said his office had no record of Ms Marquez requesting help from the authorities due to threats against her, adding \"a femicide is the worst thing\", according to news agency AFP.\"In response to claims pointing to alleged perpetrators of the femicide in Zapopan, we clarify that there are no direct accusations against any individual in the investigation file,\" the Jalisco prosecutor's office said in a statement.\"All statements and clues, including videos and social media posts, are being analysed. The investigation is being conducted under the femicide protocol, with a gender perspective, without revictimisation and in accordance with the principles of legality, impartiality and respect for human rights,\" it added.Gender-based violence is a serious problem in Mexico, a country that ranks fourth in Latin America and the Caribbean for rates of femicide, behind Paraguay, Uruguay, and Bolivia.According to the latest data from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), there were 1.3 deaths per every 100,000 women in Mexico in 2023, Reuters reported.Less than 48 hours before Ms Marquez's murder, Yesenia Lara GutiÃ©rrez, a mayoral candidate for Morena (the ruling party) in the city of Texistepec, Veracruz, was killed while participating in a political motorcade. Like the influencer's case, the politician's murder was recorded by cameras because the event was being live-streamed on Facebook."

    "content": "The body which runs Nigeria's university-entrance exams has admitted to a \"technical glitch\" which compromised some results of this year's tests, after nearly 80% of students got low grades.Students have complained about not being able to log in to the computers, questions not showing up and power cuts making it impossible to take the examinations.The low pass rate has sparked widespread outrage, especially after one candidate took her own life.Faith Opesusi Timileyin, 19, who was aspiring to study microbiology at university, died after swallowing poison, her family said.\nHer father and elder sister told the BBC that she had sat the exam for the second time and got 146 marks out of 400, lower than the 193 she had last year.\"The pain made her take her own life,\" her father, Oluwafemi Opesusi, told BBC Pidgin.Generally 200 or above out of 400 is enough to get a place in university in the exams run by the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (Jamb).Only 400,000 of the 1.9 million students achieved that mark, one of the worst performances in recent years.Following a public outcry, Jamb says that students in some areas will be able to retake their exams.One student, Favour Eke, told BBC Igbo that 10 of the 165 questions didn't appear on the screen - all she could see was the multiple choice options for the answers.\"We were told to omit the blank questions and continue the exam but it was very hard to concentrate after that,\" she said.She has also experienced technical problems getting her results, meaning she is very unlikely to get into university this year - the third time she has taken the exams.She sat the test in the capital, Abuja, which is not one of the centres where students can retake their exams, leaving her completely distraught.Another student said he had trouble logging in to the computer before someone else's profile mysteriously appeared on the screen, showing different questions and then the machine briefly shut down completely.\"I did not get to answer all the questions when they told us our time was up because a lot of my time was wasted due to those technical difficulties,\" he said.The exams body has apologised for the \"painful damage\" and \"the trauma that it has subjected affected Nigerians\".In a press conference, Jamb registrar Ishaq Oloyede broke down in tears as he apologised.He announced that almost 380,000 candidates in 157 affected centres from a total of 887, would be able to retake their exams starting from Saturday.The zones that are most affected are Lagos and several states in the south-east.Jamb blamed a failure of the computer system to upload exam responses by candidates in these areas during the first days of the exams.It said an \"unusual level of public concerns and loud complaints\" had \"prompted us to do an immediate audit or review\". Ordinarily, this would have happened in June, it said.The national exam, known as the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), is a computer-based test that is a requirement for those joining universities and other tertiary institutions.The 2025 test, which was conducted in March, was marred by disruptions due to power outages in some areas.The head of the exams body earlier this week defended the poor results, saying they reflected the \"true academic abilities\" of the students and were because of a clampdown on cheating.Many Nigerians on social media have been calling for accountability, with some seeking Oloyede's resignation.Opposition figure Peter Obi said that while the admission of fault was commendable, the issue raised \"a very concerning issue on glitches and the grave havoc\" in critical institutions.Rights activist Rinu Oduala said it was \"incompetence. It's educational sabotage. He should be arrested immediately.\"Additional reporting by Chukwunaeme Obiejesi, Andrew Gift, Madina Maishanu and Marvelous  Obomanu in Nigeria\n'I screamed': Nigerian Doctor Who fan thrilled show is coming to LagosHusband of late Nigerian gospel singer sentenced to deathNigerians fear savings lost as investment app freezes them outNigerian bandit kingpin and 100 followers killed\nGo toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter@BBCAfrica, on Facebook atBBC Africaor on Instagram atbbcafrica"

    "title": "BBC joins Gaza children as they are evacuated to Jordan for treatment",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5v2rjp84ro",
    "content": "We were flying through the warm light of the setting sun. There were villages and small towns where the lights were coming on. It was a peaceful landscape where people walked and drove without constantly looking to the sky.We were over the suburbs of Amman when Safa'a Salha held up her mobile phone so that I could read a message she'd written.\"Oh my God,\" this Gaza mother wrote, \"Jordan is so beautiful.\"The evacuees had come to the Jordanian border by road. I joined them there for the final part of the journey by helicopter to Amman.\nSafa'a spoke very little English, and in any case the noise of the helicopter made it impossible to converse.She showed me another message. \"We used to see this [helicopter] every day and it was coming to bomb and kill. But today the feeling is totally different.\"Next to her sat her 16-year-old son Youssef who showed me the scar on his head from his last surgery. He smiled and wanted to speak, not of Gaza but ordinary things. How he was excited by the helicopter, how he liked football. Youssef said he was very happy and gave me a fist bump.Beside him was nine-year-old Sama Awad, frail and scared-looking, holding the hand of her mother, Isra. Sama has a brain tumour and will have surgery in Amman.\"I hope she can get the best treatment here,\" said Isra, when we were on the ground and the noise of the engines faded.I asked a question which had been answered for me many times by looking at images, but not face to face by someone who had just left.What is Gaza like now?\"It is horrible. It is impossible to describe. Horrible on so many levels. But people are just trying to get on with living,\" Isra replied.\nFour sick children were evacuated to Jordan along with twelve parents and guardians. They left Gaza by ambulance on Wednesday morning and travelled through Israel without stopping until they reached the border crossing.The plan to evacuate children was first unveiled during a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Jordan's King Abdullah in February.Jordan's stated aim is to bring 2,000 sick children to the kingdom for treatment. So far only 33 have been evacuated to Jordan, each travelling with a parent or guardian.Jordanian sources say Israel has delayed and imposed restrictions and this - along with the resumption of the war - has impeded the evacuation process. Sick Gazans have also been evacuated to other countries via Israel.We put the Jordanian concerns to the Israeli government organisation responsible -  Cogat (Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories) - who told us that since \"the beginning of the year, and especially in recent weeks, there has been a significant increase in the number of Gazans evacuated through Israel for medical care abroad.\"Cogat said thousands of patients and escorts had gone to countries, including Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, the US and others. The statement said that \"the ongoing hostilities in the Gaza Strip pose a challenge to the implementation of these evacuation operations.\"Israel broke the last ceasefire in March launching a wave of attacks on what it said were Hamas positions.\nGaza remains a claustrophobic zone of hunger and death for its residents. Those who get out for medical treatment are the exception.According to the UN the population of 2.1 million is facing the risk of famine. The organisation's head of humanitarian affairs, Tom Fletcher, has appealed to the UN Security Council to act to \"prevent genocide\" in Gaza.These are strong words for a man trained in the sober traditions of the British Foreign Office and who has served as an ambassador and senior government advisor.The Israeli blockade is preventing essential aid supplies from reaching the population. That along with the continued bombing explain Isra Abu Jame's description of a place horrible beyond words.The children who arrived in Jordan on Wednesday from Gaza will join a small community of other wounded and sick youngsters in different Amman hospitals.Since January we have been following the case of Habiba Al-Askari, who came with her mother Rana in the hope doctors might be able to save three gangrene infected limbs - two arms, and a leg.But the infection - caused by a rare skin condition - had gone too far. Habiba underwent a triple amputation.\nWhen I met Habiba and Rana again this week, the little girl was using the toes of her remaining foot to scroll, and play children's games on her mum's phone. She blew kisses with the stump of her arm. This was a very different child to the frightened girl I met on the helicopter evacuation five months ago.\"She's a strong person,\" Rana said. Habiba will be fitted with prosthetic limbs. Already she is determined to walk, asking her mother to hold under her armpits while she hops.Some day, Rana hopes, she will take Habiba back to Gaza. Mother and child are safe and well cared for in Amman, but their entire world, their family and neighbours are back in the ruins. Concerns about Habiba's health make Rana reluctant to contemplate going back soon.\"We have no house. If we want go back where will we go? We would be going back to a tent full of sandâ¦[but] I truly want to return. Gaza is beautiful, despite everything that has happened. To me Gaza will always be the most precious spot on this entire earth.\"They will return. But to war or peace? Nobody knows.With additional reporting by Alice Doyard, Suha Kawar, Nik Millard and Malak Hassouneh."

    "title": "Beginning of the end? Ukraine's front-line soldiers eye Russia talks with hope",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8e6wj07xlno",
    "content": "Big plumes of smoke are visible on a screen that's providing a live feed from Ukrainian drones hovering over the outskirts of the eastern city of Pokrovsk, one of the most intense front lines in Ukraine.A few seconds earlier, Ukrainian artillery strikes Russian positions, places where we'd seen Russian soldiers moving about as they try to advance towards a key road going into Pokrovsk.At least one Russian soldier is injured, possibly dead after the strike.It's chilling to watch the live footage. It drives home the bloody consequences of the war that Russia started, in which hundreds of thousands have so far been killed, a \"never-ending bloodbath\" as US President Donald Trump calls it.We are in a rural house converted into a command centre for the 155th mechanised brigade of the Ukrainian army. It's a few miles from front-line artillery positions.The scale of the devastation that we see on the screens, homes and buildings completely flattened, is far greater than what we saw six months ago.It is evidence of the fierce battle that has been fought over the past several months to defend Pokrovsk, a crucial transport hub in the Donetsk region.\nThis week, there's cautious optimism, even among sceptical soldiers who have witnessed hopes of a ceasefire being dashed over and over again, as diplomatic efforts from the US, Europe, Turkey and others have pushed Russia and Ukraine to direct talks for the first time in three years.\"I think something should happen since Russia was the first one to push for these talks. I mean since 2022, they have refused to go into any contact,\" says an officer who wants to be referred to with his call sign \"Kozak\".\"I want to believe this would be the beginning of the end of the war.\"But now I see, we have been successful in destroying their rear positions and their supply lines. Russia does not have the same strength and power it had at the beginning. So I think that something will happen.\"\nYurii, 37, used to work in a technology company before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \"They (Russia and Ukraine) have to start talking. Us soldiers, we wish this war would end. But it's important to remember that we cannot stop it because we did not start it,\" he says.He looks up at the screen and spots Russian soldiers moving again. He and his colleagues calculate the co-ordinates of their positions and pass them on to their artillery unit.\nWe drive from the command centre to the artillery position, on mud tracks running through a wide expanse of open fields. Clumps of mud fly in the air, our car slips and slides, as we move as fast as possible. The speed is a mitigation against strikes from drones, which have sharply increased fatalities for both Russia and Ukraine since they were deployed in large numbers in 2023.And war technology keeps evolving. Now there's a new threat â drones equipped with a real fibre optic cable which unrolls as they fly. \"We cannot detect them or neutralise them, so there are probably a lot more drones in the area right now than we know,\" says Yurii.As we drive into the artillery position hidden under trees and bushes, soldiers are already loading the gun. It's a French made self-propelled artillery gun called the \"Caesar\". Scores have been deployed in Ukraine since the start of the war, and France has been trying to ramp up production.\n\"I'm very impressed by its accuracy, and we can use a large range of ammunition. The most important thing is that bringing it into combat is very fast. It is much more effective than the old Soviet equipment I've used,\" says Kozak.Ukrainian soldiers fire four rounds, each one emitting a deafening sound. From around us, we also hear the sound of incoming shells. The battle rages on.\"As you can hear, there is a wave of assaults from the enemy and we need a lot of ammunition to suppress that. We hope our international partners can give us as much ammunition as possible, because if we have to start choosing priority and non-priority targets then the enemy will be successful,\" says Kozak.We ask the soldiers how they feel about suggestions that Ukraine will have to make concessions, that it might have to give up land to secure peace.\"It's painful to hear that. Even I want to go home to my family. My daughter is eight and I miss her so much. But we need to be strong. I don't believe that if we give up some territory, they will stop. In a couple of years, they will return and start over,\" says Yurii.\"A person who has not come here, who hasn't felt the consequences of Russian aggression, those armchair commentators say you can give up land and everything will be over. They will never understand how many brothers and friends we have lost. We shouldn't give up a single metre of our land,\" says Kozak.\nThe cost Ukraine has paid to defend its land is visible everywhere, most acutely in the photos of smiling, young soldiers posted by the side of highways, on memorial walls in central city squares, and on rows and rows of freshly dug graves in the country.Yana Melnikova lovingly buys her son's favourite treats - a cup of steaming hot chocolate and a chocolate roll.Then she drives out to a cemetery in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, and places them neatly by 22-year-old Vladislav's grave. She and her daughter, 13-year-old Nicole, wipe the grave with wet tissues. Before long, they break down inconsolably into each other's arms.Vladislav was a drone operator with the Ukrainian military. He was killed in combat in a Russian strike on 21 February this year.For Yana, news of direct talks resuming bring no hope.\"It seems to me that this war is eternal. Of course, I hope they will find a solution. Because people are dying here and there (in Russia). But Putin is greedy. His hunger for our land is insatiable,\" says Yana.\nParts of the Zaporizhzhia region are currently occupied by Russia, the front line less than 40 miles from the city. But Russia has on more than one occasion demanded control of the full regions of Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk, Donetsk and Kherson as part of any peace deal.\"No way. I want to live in Ukraine, not Russia. We have seen what they do under occupation, what they did in places like Bucha â their cruelty and torture,\" says Yana. \"Can you imagine, they've not even spared this graveyard,\" she adds, pointing to a big crater nearby where a bomb exploded some months ago.Tears rolling down her eyes, she adds: \"I hope my child did not die for nothing. That there will still be a victory and all of Ukraine will become free.\"Additional reporting by Imogen Anderson, Volodymyr Lozhko, Anastasiia Levchenko, Sanjay Ganguly"

    "title": "Construction sites appear in Gaza ahead of Israeli-US aid plan rejected by UN, images show",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce82ene10p0o",
    "content": "Israel is preparing a series of sites in Gaza that could be used as distribution centres for humanitarian aid in a controversial new plan, satellite images show.The Israeli government suspended food and medicine deliveries into Gaza in March.Ministers said the move, which has been condemned by UN, European and Middle Eastern leaders, was intended to put pressure on Hamas to release its remaining hostages. Israel also accused Hamas of stealing aid â an allegation the group has denied.The UN has said the blockade has caused severe shortages of food, medicines and fuel, and an assessment on Monday warned that Gaza's population of around 2.1 million peoplewas at \"critical risk\" of famine.The US confirmed last week that it was preparing a new system for providing aid from a series of hubs inside Gaza, which would be run by private companies and protected by security contractors and Israeli forces.Images analysed by BBC Verify show that land has already been cleared, with new roads and staging areas constructed at a number of locations in southern and central Gaza in recent weeks.\nIsrael has not publicly said where the hubs will be, but humanitarian sources - briefed previously by Israeli officials - told BBC Verify that at least four centres will be built in the southern section of Gaza and one further north near the Netzarim Corridor, a strip of land controlled by the military that effectively divides the territory.The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation - an organisation set up to support the plan - initially said food, water and hygiene kits would be supplied to 1.2 million people, less than 60% of the population.On Wednesday it announced it would start operations before the end of May, and appeared to call for Israel to allow aid through normal channels until its distribution centres were fully operational. It also called for aid hubs to be built in northern Gaza, something not envisaged under the original plan and which had led to criticism that people would be forced to move south.UN agencies have insisted they will not co-operate with the plan - which is in line with one previously approved by Israel's government - saying it contradicted fundamental humanitarian principles.A spokesperson for the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) accused Israel of seeking to use \"food and fuel as leverage, as part of a military strategy\".\"All aid would be channelled through a handful of militarised hubs,\" Olga Cherevko told BBC Verify.\"That kind of arrangement would cut off vast areas of Gaza â particularly the most vulnerable, who can't move easily, or are otherwise marginalised â from any help at all.\"Meanwhile, Bushra Khalidi of Oxfam described the new plan as a \"farce\".\"No logistical solution is going to address Israel's strategy of forcible displacement and using starvation as a weapon of war. Lift the siege, open the crossings and let us do our job.\"It is understood that the proposed new system has not yet had final sign-off from the Israeli government.\nBBC Verify used satellite imagery to identify four potential sites based on the limited available information about their locations.The sites are similar in size, shape and design to existing open-air distribution sites inside Gaza, such as at Erez, Erez West and Kisufim. The largest site we've looked at is bigger - more comparable to the area inside Gaza at Kerem Shalom crossing.Our analysis of the imagery shows significant development at one of the sites in south-west Gaza, close to the ruins of a village that is now an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) base.Satellite photos since early April show the construction of a road there and a large staging area, surrounded by berms - large defensive barriers made of piled sand or earth - about 650m (2,130ft) from the border with Egypt.A high-resolution image captured on 8 May shows bulldozers and excavators working on a section of land spanning about 20 acres (8 hectares). IDF armoured vehicles are at a fortified building nearby.A photo taken on site, geolocated by BBC Verify, also shows lighting being installed on the perimeter.Further imagery from 11 and 12 May shows this, along with three other sites, continuing to expand. One site is about half a kilometre from a collection of eight UN warehouses, and 280m from another large warehouse.\nStu Ray - a senior imagery analyst with McKenzie Intelligence - agreed the sites were likely to be secure distribution centres. He noted that some of the facilities are in \"close proximity to IDF Forward Operating Bases which ties in with the IDF wishing to have some control over the sites\".Analysts with another intelligence firm, Maiar, said the facilities appeared to be designed with separate entrances for trucks to move in and out, and with other gaps in the berms that would be suitable for pedestrian entrances.The IDF did not comment on the potential aid centres when approached by BBC Verify, but said that its operations in Gaza were carried out \"in accordance with international law\".  Cogat - the Israeli body responsible for managing crossings into Gaza - did not respond to a request for comment.Three of the four sites located by BBC Verify are south of the IDF's newly created Morag Corridor.\nThis is an Israeli military zone that runs across the Gaza Strip and separates the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah.Since the IDF established a security zone there in early April, a six-mile (10km) road has been built covering two thirds of the width of Gaza, bordered by defensive berms and dotted with IDF outposts.This new road leads directly to one of the development sites visible in satellite imagery, and a pre-existing road connects it to two more.This entire area has been subjected to extensive land clearance by the IDF. BBC Verify has geolocated video and images of areas throughout the Morag Corridor, and south of it, filmed by Israeli forces, which show controlled demolitions using explosives and heavy machinery, and extensive destruction of buildings.Humanitarian sources said Israeli briefings indicated that aid would enter Gaza via Kerem Shalom crossing.Satellite imagery shows ongoing construction work happening there too over the past few months, with the apparent expansion of its storage areas, and new roads added.\nSince Israel stopped new aid supplies in March, the UN has reiterated that it has an obligation under international law to ensure that the basic needs of the population under its control are met.Israel has insisted that it is complying with international law and that there is no shortage of aid in Gaza.\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?"

    "title": "Why India could not stop IMF bailout to Pakistan",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v5r1erdpgo",
    "content": "Last week the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a $1bn (Â£756m) bailout to Pakistan â a move that drew sharp disapproval from India as military hostilities between the nuclear-armed neighbours flared, before aUS-led ceasefirewas unexpectedly declared.Despite India's protests, the IMF board approved the second instalment of a $7bn loan, saying Islamabad had demonstrated strong programme implementation leading to a continuing economic recovery in Pakistan.It also said the fund would continue to support Pakistan's efforts in building economic resilience to \"climate vulnerabilities and natural disasters\", providing further access of around $1.4bn in funding in the future.In a strongly wordedstatementIndia raised concerns over the decision, citing two reasons.Delhi questioned the \"efficacy\" of such bailouts or the lack thereof, given Pakistan's \"poor track record\" in implementing reform measures. But more importantly it flagged the possibility of these funds being used for \"state-sponsored cross-border terrorism\" â a charge Islamabad has repeatedly denied - and said the IMF was exposing itself and its donors to \"reputational risks\" and making a \"mockery of global values\".The IMF did not respond to the BBC's request for a comment on the Indian stance.Even Pakistani experts argue that there's some merit to Delhi's first argument. Pakistan has been prone to persistently seeking the IMF's help â getting bailed out 24 times since 1958 â without undertaking meaningful reforms to improve public governance.\"Going to the IMF is like going to the ICU [intensive care unit]. If a patient goes 24 or 25 times to the ICU then there are structural challenges and concerns that need to be dealt with,\" Hussain Haqqani, former Pakistani ambassador to the US, told the BBC.\nBut addressing Delhi's other concerns â that the IMF was \"rewarding continued sponsorship of cross-border terrorism\" thereby sending a \"dangerous message to the global community\" â is far more complex, and perhaps explains why India wasn't able to exert pressure to stall the bailout.India's decision to try to prevent the next tranche of the bailout to Islamabad was more about optics then, rather than a desire for any tangible outcome, say experts. As per the country's own observations, the fund had limited ability to do something about the loan, and was \"circumscribed by procedural and technical formalities\".As one of the 25 members of the IMF board, India's influence at the fund is limited. It represents a four-country group including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Bhutan. Pakistan is part of the Central Asia group, represented by Iran.Unlike the United Nations' one-country-one-vote system, the voting rights of IMF board members are based on a country's economic size and its contributions â a system which has increasingly faced criticism for favouring richer Western countries over developing economies.For example, the US has the biggest voting share - at 16.49% - while India holds just 2.6%. Besides, IMF rules do not allow for a vote against a proposal - board members can either vote in favour or abstain â and the decisions are made by consensus on the board.\"This shows how vested interests of powerful countries can influence decisions,\" an economist who didn't want to speak on the record told the BBC.Addressing this imbalance was a key proposal in the reforms mooted for the IMF and other multilateral lenders during India's G20 presidency in 2023.In their report, former Indian bureaucrat NK Singh and former US treasury secretary Lawrence Summers recommended breaking the link between IMF voting rights and financial contributions to ensure fairer representation for both the \"Global North\" and the \"Global South\". But there has been no progress so far on implementing these recommendations.Furthermore, recent changes in the IMF's own rules about funding countries in conflict add more complexity to the issue. A $15.6bn loan by the fund to Ukraine in 2023 was thefirst of its kindby the IMF to a country at war.\"It bent its own rules to give an enormous lending package to Ukraine - which means it cannot use that excuse to shut down an already-arranged loan to Pakistan,\" Mihir Sharma of the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) think tank in Delhi told the BBC.\nIf India really wants to address its grievances,  the right forum to present them would be the United Nations FATF (Financial Action Task Force), says Mr Haqqani.The FATF looks at issues of combating terror finance and decides whether countries need to be placed on grey or black lists that prevent them from accessing funds from bodies like the IMF or the World Bank.\"Grandstanding at the IMF cannot and did not work,\" said Mr Haqqani. \"If a country is on that [FATF] list it will then face challenges in getting a loan from the IMF â as has happened with Pakistan earlier.\"As things stand though, Pakistan was officially removed from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list in 2022.Separately, experts also caution that India's calls to overhaul the IMF's funding processes and veto powers could be a double-edged sword.Such reforms \"would inevitably give Beijing [rather than Delhi] more power\", said Mr Sharma.Mr Haqqani agrees. India should be wary of using \"bilateral disputes at multilateral fora\", he said, adding that India has historically been at the receiving end of being vetoed out by China in such places.He points to instances of Beijing blocking ADB (Asian Development Bank) loans sought by India for the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, citing border disputes between the two countries in the region.Follow BBC News India onInstagram,YouTube,TwitterandFacebook"

    "title": "Do Afrikaners want to take Trump up on his South African refugee offer?",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3q129gpe4o",
    "content": "Ulrich Janse van Vuuren has made it his passion to share and showcase some of South Africa's best features with his legion of social media followers.The 38-year-old white South African often takes snapshots capturing scenes such as a cold Johannesburg morning, the purple Jacaranda trees famously associated with Pretoria or Cape Town's popular beachfronts.\"Promoting South Africa is something I am passionate about - I have no intention of taking up [US President Donald Trump's] offer because South Africa is my home,\" the proud Afrikaner tells the BBC, days after a small group of his fellow white compatriots left South Africa for their new life as refugees in the US.The US president, and his South-Africa born ally Elon Musk, says that white Afrikaners are being persecuted in their home country, and that they are being subjected to a \"genocide\".This is a claim that has been circulating for many years even though ithas been widely discredited.Although some white farmers have been attacked and killed, South Africa has one of the world's highest murder rates, so this is an issue that affects all of its citizens, whatever their race.\n\"For me, South Africa is home. It's a place where my roots and heritage are, where I can contribute to the story of our nation and make a meaningful impact,\" said Mr Janse van Vuuren, who has more than one million followers on social media.\"I'm deeply invested in South Africa's success and I am proud to be part of its journey.\"And while he wished those who have taken up Trump's offer all the best in the US and urged them to \"not look back\", he insisted that none of them were refugees, but rather \"opportunists\".\"They've enjoyed more than their share of South Africa's resources and privileges, and none are fleeing racial persecution,\" he said.Thirty years after the end of the racist system of apartheid, average living standards among South Africa's white community remain far higher than for the black majority.Mr Janse van Vuuren said that the debate about the status of Afrikaners in South Africa had only served to make him \"more determined than ever to step up and contribute to South Africa in every way I can\".Four centuries after the first group of Dutch settlers arrived in what is now South Africa, most Afrikaners regard themselves as fully African â as seen in the name â and no longer identify with their European roots.But many are unhappy both with the high crime rate and the government's policies aimed at reducing economic inequality in the country â especially alaw passed earlier this yearthat allowed the government to seize land without compensation \"when it is just and equitable and in the public interest\". White South Africans are 7% of the country's population, but own half of its farmland.Some Afrikaners are farmers and see the law as being aimed at them.Trump said the legislation prompted him to offer to help resettle \"Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination\".The status of white South African farmers has long been a rallying cry on the right and far-right of American politics.But despite numerous claims in the past of the systematic targeting of the country's white Afrikaner minority group, local crime statistics figures paint a different picture.South Africa does not release crime figures based on race but the latest figures revealed that 6,953 people were murdered in the country between October and December 2024. Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks. Of the 12, one was a farmer, while five were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black.\nOn Monday, thefirst group of 59 Afrikaners granted refugee status arrived at the Dulles airport near Washington DCafter choosing to leave their home country.The arrival of the group drew dismay and outrage across South Africa, as the country's civil society and leadership sought to dispel the claims that the white minority was being persecuted.\"They are leaving because they don't want to embrace the changes that are taking place in our country and our constitution,\" said South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.He laterlabelled their move a \"cowardly act\"as he addressed farmers at a convention held in the Free State province.The president's sentiments were echoed by many South Africans, including Mr Janse van Vuuren, who is proud of his Afrikaner origins.While he was not raised in a farming family, he has relatives and friends in agriculture who have been victims of crime.He said that while it was undeniable that some farmers faced \"genuine threats and hardships\", it was important to be cautious \"when discussing claims of persecution or discrimination that portray an entire group as victims of targeted violence or systemic oppression\".While many white South Africans echo Mr Janse van Vuuren's sentiments, there are also those who see themselves as a persecuted minority.Among them is Ilse Steenkamp, who along with her family, has applied for the programme but has not received feedback. She did not want us to use her real name.Ms Steenkamp, 47, and her husband, both Afrikaners, were commercial farmers but said they had lost their land recently after it was invaded by people who \"took over the whole farm\" just as they were about to sell it in order to \"downscale\".She said they had bought the land two decades ago, after the end of apartheid.The people who invaded destroyed critical infrastructure, making it impossible to sell, she said.Despite efforts to have them removed through the courts, Ms Steenkamp said they were forced to abandon the land as it was repossessed by the bank.Ms Steenkamp said that while she and her family were familiar with South Africa's high crime levels and often tried to \"not let it get us under\", this latest attack \"was the straw that broke the camel's back\".Even though her family were eager to embrace Trump's offer when it was first announced, the mother-of-three told the BBC that the decision to leave \"was very difficult because you're... leaving a whole way of life\".Asked whether it was unfair that Afrikaners were being granted refugee status at a time when the US was cracking down on refugees and asylum seekers from everywhere else in the world, Ms Steenkamp said she \"completely disagreed\".She pointed to assaults on farmers, saying there was a \"hatred that seems to go with these attacks\".\"Any farmer that has gone through that [kind of] attack and is now wanting to flee, I think should be treated as a refugee because they are fleeing from a government that will not even admit that these things are happening,\" she said.\nSam BusÃ , 60, is another white South African who has applied for the refugee programme.She is the founder of Amerikaners, a platform aimed at providing information to white South Africans interested in the US resettlement offer.While Ms BusÃ , who is of English, not Afrikaner, descent, and her three sons have submitted their applications, they have not been interviewed yet.While it was initially believed that the executive order, vague in its original wording, only applied to white Afrikaners, Ms BusÃ  said it \"clearly is targeting white South Africans\".On Monday, the US embassy in South Africa released a statement clarifying the criteria for those applying for resettlement, which said applicants need to be:Of South African nationalityAfrikaner or from a racial minorityAble to cite an incident of past persecution or fear of persecution in the futureResponding to the criticism that they were not genuine refugees, Ms BusÃ  said: \"When someone strips away your hope for the future, even though you're not in a warzone... someone ripping away your dreams and hope for the future, that is very dramatic. It's a mental anguish and emotional abuse in a sense.\"PODCAST: Are white Afrikaners really being targeted in South Africa?What's really driving Trump's fury with South Africa?Is it checkmate for South Africa after Trump threats?But Dr Piet Croucamp, an associate professor in political studies at South Africa's North West University, disagreed, echoing the view that those taking up this offer were not refugees as \"South Africa does not persecute people\".Rather, he speculated that it may be those who have been victims of a crime and \"could define their existence as an unsecure one\".Dr Croucamp, who is an Afrikaner, said that while he did not expect a significant number of white South Africans to follow suit, there would always be \"opportunistic\" people taking advantage of the situation.\"This is a small group of people leaving â the vast majority of Afrikaners are going nowhere and they have expressed themselves. Even the right-wing Afrikanersâ¦ [like] AfriForum and Solidarityhave said they are not going anywhere. So even within Afrikaner circles, this is a small group of people,\" he said.Despite their criticism of the government and its race-based policies, prominent Afrikaner lobby groups AfriForum and the Solidarity Movement have both reiterated their intention to remain in South Africa.AfriForum said that while the government was to blame for the departure of the group granted refugee status, they would stay and continue their \"efforts to help create a future for Afrikaners here at the southern tip of Africa\".This is a view with which Mr Janse van Vuuren agreed.\"While some may choose to leave as refugees, the majority of us are here to stay, working together to build a better future for all in South Africa.\"\nRacially charged row between Musk and South Africa over StarlinkThe expelled envoy at the heart of the latest US-South Africa rowSouth Africa in 'uncharted waters' as budget splits coalition government\nGo toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter@BBCAfrica, on Facebook atBBC Africaor on Instagram atbbcafrica"

    "title": "Meet the 'invisible crew' who have 35 seconds to prevent a Eurovision blunder",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1e679vn6yqo",
    "content": "Thirty-five seconds. That's all the time you get to change the set at Eurovision.Thirty-five seconds to get one set of performers off the stage and put the next ones in the right place.Thirty-five seconds to make sure everyone has the right microphones and earpieces.Thirty-five seconds to make sure the props are in place and tightly secured.While you're at home watching the introductory videos known as postcards, dozens of people swarm the stage, setting the scene for whatever comes next.\"We call it the Formula 1 tyre change,\" says Richard van Rouwendaal, the affable  Dutch stage manager who makes it all work.\"Each person in the crew can only do one thing. You run on stage with one light bulb or one prop. You always walk on the same line. If you go off course, you will hit somebody.\"It's a bit like ice skating.\"\nThe stage crew start rehearsing their \"F1 tyre change\" weeks before the contestants even arrive.Every country sends detailed plans of their staging, and Eurovision hires stand-ins to play the acts (in Liverpool 2023, it was pupils from the local performing arts school), while stagehands start shaving precious seconds off the changeovers.\"We have about two weeks,\" says Van Rouwendaal, who's normally based in Utrecht but isin Basel for this year's contest.\"My company is around 13 Dutchies and 30 local guys and girls, who rock it in Switzerland.\"In those two weeks, I have to figure out who's right for each job. Someone's good at running, someone's good at lifting, someone's good at organising the backstage area. It is a bit like being good at Tetris because you have to line everything up in a small space, in the perfect way.\"As soon as a song finishes, the team are ready to roll.As well as the stagehands, there are people responsible for positioning lights and setting pyrotechnics; and 10 cleaners who sweep the stage with mops and vacuum cleaners between every performance.\"My cleaners are just as important as the stage crew. You need a clean stage for the dancers  - but also, if there's an overhead shot of somebody lying down, you don't want to see shoeprints on the floor.\"The attention to detail is clinical. Backstage, every performer has their own microphone stand, set to the correct height and angle, to make sure every  performance is camera perfect.\"Sometimes the delegation will say the artist wants to wear a different shoe for the grand final,\" says Van Rouwendaal. \"But if that happens, the mic stand is at the wrong height, so we've got a problem!\"\nSpontaneously changing footwear isn't the worst problem he's faced, though. At the 2022 contest in Turin, the stage was 10m (33ft) higher than the backstage area.As a result, they were pushing heavy stage props â including a mechanical bull â up a steep ramp between every act.\"We were exhausted every night,\" he recalls. \"This year is better. We've even got an extra backstage tent where we prepare the props.\"\nProps are a huge part of Eurovision. The tradition started at the second ever contest in 1957, when Germany's Margot Hielscher sang part of her songTelefon, Telefoninto (you guessed it) a telephone.Over the intervening decades, the staging has become ever more elaborate. In 2014, Ukraine's Mariya Yaremchuk trapped one of her dancers in a giant hamster wheel, while Romania brought a literal cannon to their performance in 2017.\nWhat time is the Eurovision final and who is in it?Your guide to all 37 Eurovision songsUK act Remember Monday: 'The closer we get, the hungrier we become'CÃ©line Dion sends message to EurovisionHow to win Eurovision, according to the expertsSwiss host city Basel promises 'everyone is welcome'\nThis year, we've got disco balls, space hoppers, a magical food blender, a Swedish sauna and, for the UK, a fallen chandelier.\"It's a big logistics effort, actually, to get all the props organised,\" says Damaris Reist, deputy head of production for this year's contest.\"It's all organised in a kind of a circle. The [props] come onto the stage from the left, and then get taken off to the right.\"Backstage, the props that have been used are pushed back to the back of the queue, and so on. It's all in the planning.\"\nDuring the show, there are several secret passageways and \"smuggling routes\" to get props in and out of vision, especially when a performance requires new elements half-way through.Cast your mind back, if you will, to Sam Ryder's performance for the UK at the 2022 contest in Italy.There he was, alone on the stage, belting out falsetto notes in his spangly jumpsuit, when suddenly, an electric guitar appeared out of thin air and landed in his hands.And guess who put it there? Richard van Rouwendaal.\"I'm a magician,\" he laughs. \"No, no, noâ¦ That was a collaboration between the camera director, the British delegation and the stage crew.\"In other words, Richard ducked onto the stage, guitar in hand, while the director cut to a wide shot, concealing his presence from viewers at home.\"It's choreographed to the nearest millimetre,\" he says. \"We're not invisible, but we have to be invisible.\"\nWhat if it all goes wrong?There are certain tricks the audience will never notice, Van Rouwendaal reveals.If he announces \"stage not clear\" into his headset, the director can buy time by showing an extended shot of the audience.In the event of a bigger incident â \"a camera can break, a prop can fall\" â they cut to a presenter in the green room, who can fill for a couple of minutes.Up in the control room, a tape of the dress rehearsal plays in sync with the live show, allowing directors to switch to pre-recorded footage in the event of something like a stage invasion or a malfunctioning microphone.A visual glitch isn't enough to trigger the back-up tape, however - as Switzerland's ZoÃ« MÃ« discovered at Tuesday's first semi-final.Her performance was briefly interrupted when the feed from an on-stage camera froze, but producers simply cut to a wide shot until it was fixed. (If it had happened in the final, she'd have been offered the chance to perform again.)\"There's actually lots of measures that are being taken to make sure that every act can be shown in the best way,\" says Reist.\"There are people who know the regulations by heart, who have been playing through what could happen and what we would do in various different situations.\"I'll be sitting next to our head of production, and if there's [a situation] where somebody has to run, maybe that's going to be me!\"\nIt's no surprise to learn that staging a live three-hour broadcast with thousands of moving parts is incredibly stressful.This year, organisers have introduced measures to protect the welfare of contestants and crew, including closed-door rehearsals, longer breaks between shows, and the creation of a \"disconnected zone\" where cameras are banned.Even so, Reist says she has worked every weekend for the past two months, while Van Rouwendaal and his team are regularly pulling 20-hour days.The shifts are so long that, back in 2008, Eurovision production legend Ola Melzig  built a bunker under the stage, complete with a sofa, a \"sadly underused\" PS3 and two (yes, two) espresso machines.\"I don't have hidden luxuries like Ola. I'm not at that level yet!\" laughs Van Rouwendaal\"But backstage, I've got a spot with my crew. We've got stroopwafels there and, last week, it was King's Day in Holland, so I baked pancakes for everyone.\"I try to make it fun. Sometimes we go out and have a drink and cheer because we had a great day.\"Yes, we have to be on top, and we have to be sharp as a knife, but having fun together is also very important.\"And if all goes to plan, you won't see them at all this weekend."

    "title": "What did Erik and Lyle Menendez do and when could they be released?",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y2dgep4zzo",
    "content": "In 1989, brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez killed their parents by shooting them multiple times at close range at their mansion in Beverly Hills.They were found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to murder in 1996, and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.However, in a resentencing hearing in Los Angeles a judge reduced their term, making them eligible for parole.Public interest in the case has grown since a new Netflix drama, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, was released in September.\nIn 2024, the previous district attorney of Los Angeles, George GascÃ³n, requested that the brothers' sentence of life without the possibility of parole be changed to 50 years to life.The issue was put to Los Angeles County superior court Judge Michael Jesic on 13 May, who agreed.\"I do believe they've done enough in the past 35 years that they should get that chance,\" he said, concluding a day-long hearing.Menendez sentences reduced, given them chance of freedomThe brothers are now eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law which allows individuals who committed crimes before the age of 26 to seek a reduced sentence.The siblings were aged 18 and 21 at the time. They are now aged 54 and 57.\nDuring the hearing, family members and a former fellow inmate were among those who testified in support of the resentencing.People who worked with the brothers in prison spoke about the educational courses they had completed, and described a hospice initiative they created for the elderly and sick.The district attorney's office, which fiercely opposes a lower sentence, said the brothers have continued to \"make excuses\" for their conduct instead of taking full responsibility and were not rehabilitated.The brothers spoke to the court via video and apologised for their actions.They also expressed their hope to work with sex abuse victims and help those incarcerated if they were given a second chance outside prison.\nThe California parole board will now decide whether to release the brothers from prison.Separately, the state's governor, Gavin Newsom, is considering a request from the brothers for clemency. If approved, it could lead to a reduced sentence or a pardon.Governor Newsom requested that the parole board conduct a risk assessment that examines whether the brothers pose a risk to the general public if released.The full report has not been released, but the district attorney said it indicated a \"moderate risk of violence\".The parole board hearing on the clemency petition is set to take place on 13 June.It is unclear whether the board will also consider the possibility of parole based on Judge Jesic's resentencing at the same hearing.\nLyle and Erik Menendez killed their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, on 20 August 1989 at their home in Beverly Hills.Their father, a 45-year-old Hollywood executive, was shot six times with a shotgun the brothers had purchased days before the attack.Their mother died after suffering 10 shotgun blasts to several parts of her body.The brothers initially told police they found their parents dead when they arrived home.They were arrested after the girlfriend of a psychologist that had been treating Erik Menendez went to police to say that he had physically threatened the doctor.\nThe brothers claimed they committed the murders in self defence after years of alleged physical, emotional and sexual abuse, although no molestation was ever proven in court.They said they feared their father would kill them after they threatened to expose him.However, prosecutors argued that the young men had killed their successful parents to inherit their multi-million-dollar estate.\nThe brothers were taken into custody in 1990, and in 1993 they were tried for the murders, first individually, with one jury for each brother.However, both juries were deadlocked in 1994, resulting in a mistrial, and the pair were later tried again together in 1995.During their joint trial the judge excluded apparent evidence of abuse from their defence case. Taped sessions with a doctor, in which the killings were discussed, were ruled admissible in court by the judge.A jury found them guilty and the pair were convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to murder in 1996.The brothers, who were separated during their detention after a detective who investigated the slayings said they may conspire to escape if housed together, reunited in jail in 2018.\nThe case was thrust back into the spotlight after Netflix released a drama series about the brothers in September 2024.Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, shot to the top of the platform's streaming chart and was reported to have had more than 12 million views in the first weekend after release alone.The programme explores what might have led the siblings to kill their parents and presents the murders from different perspectives.Its creators said the series was based on extensive research.It includes the brothers' claims of abuse as well as showing things from the parents' point of view.The show introduced the case to a new generation and garnered attention from celebrities - including Kim Kardashian and Rosie O'Donnell - who called for the brothers to be released.The series was a follow-up to the controversial first Monsters series about US serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer.\nFollowing its release, Erik Menendez shared a statement, released on X by his wife.He said the show was \"disheartening slander\" and he \"believed we had moved beyond the lies and ruinous character portrayals of Lyle\".\"It is sad for me to know that Netflix's dishonest portrayal of the tragedies surrounding our crime have taken the painful truths several steps backward - back through time to an era when the prosecution built a narrative on a belief system that males were not sexually abused, and that males experienced rape trauma differently than women,\" he added.Members of the family also spoke out and said the brothers had been \"victimised by this grotesque shockadrama,\" and the show was \"riddled with mistruths\".Ryan Murphy, who created the show,told Varietythat the comments were \"predictable at best\".He added that the family's response was \"interesting because I would like specifics about what they think is shocking or not shocking. It's not like we're making any of this stuff up. It's all been presented before\"."

    "content": "Svitlana says her daughter loved her school in Poland.\"Even when we moved to another area, she didn't want to change schools,\" says the 31-year-old Ukrainian mother. \"She liked it so much. There was no bullying.\"Now she says the atmosphere at the school â and in Poland overall â has changed.\"Two weeks ago, she came home and said \"One boy said to me today, 'Go back to Ukraine'.\" Svitlana was astonished.She is one of dozens of Ukrainians living in Poland who have told the BBC that anti-Ukrainian sentiment has risen considerably in recent months.Many described experiencing abuse on public transport, bullying in schools and xenophobic material online.A polarising presidential election campaign has added to the tension, with the first round of voting taking place on Sunday.\nThe day after Svitlana's daughter was told to go back to Ukraine, the abuse became even worse.\"Girls from the class above started complaining about her speaking Ukrainian. Then they pretended to fall to the ground shouting 'Missile! Get down!' and laughing,\" Svitlana says. \"She came home crying.\"A Russian missile had slammed into Svitlana's hometown in Ukraine days before, killing scores of civilians, including children. Her daughter was traumatised.Svitlana â not her real name  did not want to be identified as shefears reprisals. She showed us screenshots of messages with school staff where she complains about her daughter's treatment.She said she had noticed attitudes changing towards Ukrainians in other places, too: \"At work, many people have been saying Ukrainians come here and behave badly. And my Ukrainian friends say they want to go home because Polish people don't accept us. It's frightening to live here now.\"According to government statistics, at least 2.5 million Ukrainians live in Poland, comprising almost 7% of the total population of Poland.When the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, there was an outpouring of compassion from Poles. \"It was amazing. Every day people were calling, asking, 'How can we help?'\" says activist Natalia Panchenko, head of the Warsaw-based 'Stand with Ukraine' Foundation.\n\"Some of them organised humanitarian convoys or brought refugees here. They gave their houses, food, everything they have â and their hearts, too.\"Three years later, Natalia says she believes the majority of Poles still support Ukraine. But some don't â and her organisation has noticed an upsurge of anti-Ukrainian online abuse that began several months ago.\"Then it started to come to real life,\" she says. \"Recently, we have more and more of these kinds of situationsâ¦ xenophobic [abuse] of people working in shops or hotels just because they speak with a Ukrainian accent.\"Natalia says that many Ukrainian refugees are traumatised. \"These groups of women and children are in Poland because of the war, very often their relatives are on the front line, in captivity or dead... and this is the group of people being targeted.\"Research suggests that Poland's public opinion of Ukrainians is indeed worsening. According to a March 2025 poll by the respected CBOS Centre, just 50% of Poles are in favour of accepting Ukrainian refugees, a fall of seven percentage points in four months. Two years ago, the figure was 81%.Around a million Ukrainians are officially registered as having arrived after the start of the full-scale invasion. Poland spends 4.2% of its GDP on Ukrainian refugees.\nUkraine has become a hot-button political issue in Poland's crucial presidential election campaign.Far-right populist Slawomir Mentzen, currently polling third, is virulently anti-Ukrainian and supports an \"agreement\" with Russia's Vladimir Putin.In second place is conservative Karol Nawrocki, who opposes EU and Nato membership for Ukraine and financial assistance for refugees, but supports the war effort.The most pro-Ukraine candidate is front-runner Rafal Trzaskowski from Prime Minister Donald Tusk's coalition, although even he has promised a reduction in social welfare for Ukrainians.Trzaskowski has refrained from espousing his pro-Ukrainian credentials in order to attract the centrist vote in the elections, says political analyst Marcin Zaborowski.\"He's responding to the change in public attitudes. The initial enthusiasm for supporting war victims is disappearing, negative sentiments are taking over and it's not an entirely comfortable issue for him.\"Another far-right candidate, Grzegorz Braun, is under investigation by police for tearing down a Ukrainian flag from a city hall building during an election rally in April. Braun, who is polling at just 3%, regularly fulminates against what he calls the \"Ukrainisation of Poland\".Last week, the Polish government warned of an \"unprecedented attempt\" by Russia to interfere in the Polish elections by spreading \"false information among Polish citizens online\". Moscow denies all allegations of election interference.\nMichal Marek, who runs an NGO that monitors disinformation and propaganda in Poland, offers some examples of the anti-Ukraine material being circulated on social media.\"The main narratives are that Ukrainians are stealing money from the Polish budget, that Ukrainians do not respect us, that they want to rob and kill us and are responsible for the war,\" he says.\"This information starts in Russian-speaking Telegram channels, and, after that, we see the same photos and the same text just translated by Google Translate. And they are pushing [the material] into the Polish infosphere.\"Mr Marek links such disinformation directly with the increase in anti-Ukraine sentiment in Poland, and says an increasing number of Poles are becoming influenced by propaganda.\"But we will only see the effect after the election - what percentage of Poles want to vote for openly pro-Russian candidates.\""

    "title": "The heartbeat of a billion: What Virat Kohli meant to India",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp857gryxn1o",
    "content": "Virat Kohli's retirement from Tests has left Indian cricket beleaguered and the sporting world gasping in surprise.Coming on the heels of captain Rohit Sharma quitting a few days earlier, it adds up to a double whammy for India who embark on a tough tour of England for a five-Test series come June without their two most experienced batters.Like Sharma, Kohli took to Instagram, where he commands more than 270 million followers, to make his retirement public.\"As I step away from this format, it's not easy â but it feels rightâ¦'' he explained to his disconsolate fans.Tributes for Kohli have come in a deluge since: from fellow cricketers, past and present, old and young, and also legends from other disciplines like tennis ace Novak Djokovic and football star Harry Kane, which highlights the sweep and heft of Kohli's global appeal.Leading India to victory in the Under-19 World Cup in 2008, Kohli was fast tracked into international cricket by the then-chairman of selectors, former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar, against the judgement of others in the cricket establishment.\"Many in the Indian cricket board felt he was too young but he was scoring heavily in domestic cricket, and the hunger to succeed was palpable in him,\" recalls Vengsarkar.An example of Kohli's obsessive passion for the sport comes imbued with poignancy. Kohli was playing his second Ranji Trophy match for Delhi. His father passed away suddenly with his team in a crisis. After the funeral, he went back and scored a battling 90.\nVengsarkar's approving eye earned Kohli an ODI debut in 2009. At 23, he was the youngest member of India's 2011 ODI World Cup winning team under MS Dhoni. A few weeks later, he made his Test debut in the West Indies. Some months on, during the disastrous tour of Australia with his place under threat, Kohli made a gritty maiden century and never looked back. Within a couple of years he established himself as the pre-eminent batter of his generation.Brash and provocative, without a benign muscle in his body, he was as volatile as potassium on water in his early years. He was unafraid to take on the most reputed opponents, often indulging in on-field fracases that sometimes earned him criticism.Happily, this was not to become his defining identity in cricket. Prolific run-getting in dashing style across formats provided another more compelling dimension and was to take him to the pinnacle.When his idol Sachin Tendulkar retired in 2013, Kohli, allying unbridled ambition with his abundant skills, grabbed the baton hungrily and went on to sketch one of the most stellar careers in cricket history.He wielded the bat like a Jedi, with great skill and telling thrust to slay opponents, as it were. Coupled with his high-octane persona, his scintillating batting made him a cult hero whose very presence ensured blockbuster box-office returns everywhere he played.Kohli always wore his passion on his sleeve. He was always demonstrative and dramatic on the field but over a period of time, misplaced angst was sublimated into a raging inner pursuit of excellence that took him to dizzying heights.Marriage to film star Anushka Sharma made them the country's foremost power couple, putting both under the glare of even more intense spotlight.Metaphorically, Kohli's outstanding exploits, especially in the first decade of his career, epitomised the emerging India of the 21st century: unabashedly, unrelentingly ambitious, discarding all past demons, willing to take on the best in the world.His achievements across formats are monumental.In ODIs, he is third in run aggregate behind Tendulkar and Kumar Sangakarra, but boasts the best average (57.88) among batters who have played more than 100 games. His ability to win ODI matches in the most daunting run chases is the stuff of folklore, many of his record 51 centuries coming in such pursuit.\nIn T20s, his run aggregate and centuries don't put him in the top five, but he's immortalised himself with incredible knocks, notably 82 not out in an emotion-charged, pulsating match against arch-rivals Pakistan in the 2022 World Cup and a vital 76 in the 2024 final against South Africa, which helped India win the title.He is also the highest run scorer in the history of the Indian Premier League.At one point, Kohli averaged 50-plus in all three formats, making him the most productive and versatile batter of his era - way ahead of contemporaries Joe Root, Kane Williamson and Steve Smith. The four were locked in a fascinating, long-running race for batting supremacy.When it appeared he would break all batting records, Kohli's career took an inexplicable downturn. From the start of the pandemic, the flow of runs began to ebb and centuries became a trickle. In his pomp â between 2014 and 2019 â he had been unstoppable, at one time scoring six double centuries in just 18 months.The drought of runs hit him most adversely in Test cricket where his average, from a high of 55-plus in 2019 slumped to the current 46.75. In this period, Kohli also lost the captaincy, though his stellar standing in international cricket remained untouched.Kohli finishes his Test career with 9,230 runs, which puts him 19th overall in aggregate, and fourth among Indians behind Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sunil Gavaskar, all of whom finished with a 50-plus average and more centuries. But to judge him only on this yardstick would diminish the massive impact he has had on this format .As captain, Kohli easily hurdles over Gavaskar, Tendulkar and Dravid. In Test cricket, winning 40 of the 68 matches he led in, making him the fourth most successful in the format. In the Indian context, this assumes Himalayan proportions.Former Australia captain Greg Chappell says that Kohli's energy, grit, sense of purpose and aura was \"transformative\" for Indian cricket. Chappell marks him out as the most influential Indian captain, ahead of even Sourav Ganguly and M S Dhoni.Former India captain and chief coach Ravi Shastri, who collaborated with Kohli for years, gives first-hand perspective.\"Kohli made India into a fighting unit, especially when playing overseas,\" says Shastri.\nThe lack of ICC and IPL titles according to Shastri, is misleading as an index to his  captaincy ability.\"He always played to win, sought and nurtured fast bowlers to win overseas, demanded high intent and supreme fitness from all players, putting himself in the forefront, not as a backseat driver.\"For seven years when Kohli and Shastri collaborated, India were in the top three in ICC rankings in all formats almost continuously which is unprecedented.The most cherished and significant triumph of  this period came in 2018 when India beat Australia in its own backyard in a Test series for the first time ever.Australia is where Kohli had launched himself into batting greatness, scoring 692 runs in four Tests in 2014-15. In 2018, he contributed as captain and batter to break an hitherto unassailable psychological barrier. In 2020 touring Australia, Kohli played only one match (which was lost) returning home for the birth of his child. But India, having overcome the mental barrier two years earlier, went on to win the rubber in a melodramatic see-saw series.Australia was Kohli's happy hunting ground and his last visit Down Under in late 2024 grabbed worldwide attention. He began with a roar, hitting  a century in the first test at Perth. But his form fizzled out alarmingly and made only 190 runs in the five Tests.How much this contributed to his decision to retire is moot. Advancing years, the dislike of being constantly under harsh scrutiny, wanting to be close to his young family and behind the scene shenanigans that abound in Indian cricket have doubtless played a part too.Kohli ends his retirement post on Instagram enigmatically.\"I'll always look back at my Test career with a smile. #269 signing off,\" he wrote.The greatest ambassador for the five-day format in the last decade and a half had moved into the sunset.Follow BBC News India onInstagram,YouTube,TwitterandFacebook."

Will you stop at 10, or should I prepare for more?\" he recently asked.The crowd, at a rally in the capital, Nairobi, responded that they had even more.Before he was elected president in 2022, Ruto attracted handles that bolstered his reputation as a man of the people.Hustler- Kenyan parlance for someone eking out a living against the odds - helped portray him as someone who would prioritise the needs of the struggling folk.Chicken Seller, referring to his childhood when he hawked poultry on the roadside, resonated with many who saw his life as an epitome of their own.\"These were very positive [names]. They sold him to the public in terms of votes,\" political analyst Prof Herman Manyora told the BBC, arguing that they helped catapult him into the top job.\"Names really stick with Ruto,\" he added.\nBut the president has been a high-profile figure in Kenyan politics for a long time, including serving as deputy president for nine years until 2022, and has never been far from controversy.Prof Manyora recalls the labelArap Mashambaâ which translates as \"son of farms\" â coined just under a decade ago and relates to Ruto's ownership of vast tracts of land across the country. Concerns have been raised about how some of these have been acquired.In 2013, a court ordered Ruto to surrender a 100-acre (40-hectare) farm and compensate a farmer who had accused him of grabbing it during the 2007 post-election violence. He denied any wrongdoing.Ruto's penchant for quoting Bible verses also earned him theDeputy Jesustag. He has also been given the nameNabii, or prophet.However, it is since his rise to the presidency that the nickname manufacturers have been working overtime â with at least a dozen being created - and they have become increasingly critical.One that has stood out isZakayo- Swahili for the name Zaccheaus, a Biblical figure who is portrayed as a greedy tax collector who climbed a tree to see Jesus.The âtax collectorâ president sparking Kenyan angerBBC identifies security forces who shot Kenya anti-tax protestersRuto's government introduced a raft of unpopular taxes and many Kenyans began to say that he had betrayed the \"hustlers\".\"He failed to deliver after becoming president,\" Prof Manyora said.The pain of paying more taxes, and a perception that the extra money will be wasted, is the focus of many conversations.Last year, young people came out onto the streets of Nairobi for weeks of protests, which turned deadly, against a fresh government proposal to raise taxes that was later dropped.\nThe chant \"Ruto must go\" became a rallying call for the demonstrators and nowMust Gohas become another way to refer to the leader.The creative christeners have also focussed on the allegation that the president enjoys foreign travel.Hence the titleVasco da Ganyaâ a play on the name of the 15th Century Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, and the Swahili word danganya, which means \"to lie\".Africa's 'flying presidents' under fireRuto's honesty has also been called into question withKaunda Uongoman, which mimics late Congolese musician Kanda Bongoman.The first part refers to the president's love for the Kaunda suit - a safari jacket with matching trousers â and Uongoman, which incorporates the Swahili word uongo, meaning \"lies\".But the president seems impervious to this volley of verbal attacks.Government spokesman Isaac Mwaura said the manifold nicknames \"don't raise concerns\" in the office of the president but simply \"capture how people view a person\".Ruto is \"very hands-on and doing his best to transform the economy... It's normal for any leader to have many nicknames as this signifies his various attributes and initiatives as a leader\", he told the BBC.Mwaura also argued that the government has had to raise taxes to pay for new projects, reduce the budget deficit and fix the economy.Nevertheless, when people have gone beyond inventing new names and used satire and forms of art to ridicule the president, there has been a negative reaction from officials.Some cartoons and AI-generated images, including showing the president in a casket, have been described as \"reckless\" and \"distasteful\".Some of the alleged producers of this online content have been victims of abductions. This, Prof Manyora said, should be seen as a sign of intolerance by the government.Lachon Kiplimo, a 23-year-old university student, said that while he supported the president, some of the promises he has made have been \"unrealistic\", which fuels the nicknames.He cited the use ofEl Chapo, referring to the former Mexican drug lord, after Ruto promised a machine that would produce a million chapatis (also known as chapo in Kenya) every day to feed schoolchildren in the capital.\nMr Kiplimo however reckons that the way the president brushes off the monikers, and in fact seems to embrace them, shows how strong he is.Prof Manyora believes the young people who come up with the alternative labels for the president do it as a form of catharsis, a way of releasing tension.This view is backed up by 24-year-old student Margaret Wairimu Kahura, who said that many Kenyans \"are in a lot of pain\".She feels that the mockery is a way of letting Ruto know how the youth are feeling.She says that no other Kenyan president has been subjected to this level of lampooning, and \"so this is unique [but] in a bad way\".It is true that previous heads of state had nicknames but they have not been so numerous.The last President, Uhuru Kenyatta, was called Kamwana (\"young boy\"), Jayden (a Kenyan reference to a pampered or lazy child) and Wamashati (for his love of print shirts).His predecessor, Mwai Kibaki, was known as General Kiguoya (a general who is afraid) and Fence Sitter.Perhaps the age of social media, with its insatiable appetite for new content to keep people amused, has increased the trend towards name calling.But for many, like Ms Kahura, the volume of nicknames for Ruto are a genuine reflection of \"the different problems that people are facing\".\nHow Kenya's evangelical president has fallen out with churchesKenyan president's humbling shows power of African youthProtesters set fire to Kenya's parliament - but also saved two MPs\nGo toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter@BBCAfrica, on Facebook atBBC Africaor on Instagram atbbcafrica"

    "title": "How real is the risk of nuclear war between India and Pakistan?",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2e373yzndro",
    "content": "In the latest India-Pakistan stand-off, there were no ultimatums, no red buttons.Yet the cycle of military retaliation, veiled signals and swift international mediation quietly evoked the region's most dangerous shadow. The crisis didn't spiral towards nuclear war, but it was a reminder of how quickly tensions here can summon that spectre.Even scientists have modelled how easily things could unravel. A 2019 study by a global team of scientists opened with anightmare scenariowhere a terroristattack on India's parliament in 2025 triggers a nuclear exchange with Pakistan.Six years later, areal-world stand-off- though contained by aUS-brokered ceasefireon Saturday - stoked fears of a full-blown conflict. It also revived uneasy memories of how fragile stability in the region can be.As the crisis escalated, Pakistan sent \"dual signals\" - retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting, a calculated reminder of its nuclear capability. The NCA oversees control and potential use of the country's nuclear arsenal. Whether this move was symbolic, strategic or a genuine alert, we may never know. It also came just as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly stepped in to defuse the spiral.President Trump said the US didn't just broker a ceasefire - it averted a\"nuclear conflict\". On Monday, in an address to the nation, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: \"[There] isno tolerance for nuclear blackmail; India will not be intimidated by nuclear threats.\"Any terrorist safe haven operating under this pretext will face precise and decisive strikes,\" Modi added.India and Pakistaneach possess about 170 nuclear weapons, according to the think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). As of January 2024, Sipri estimated there were 12,121 nuclear warheads worldwide. Of these, about 9,585 were held in military stockpiles, with 3,904 actively deployed - 60 more than the previous year. The US and Russia together account for more than 8,000 nuclear weapons.The bulk of both India's and Pakistan's deployed arsenals lies in their land-based missile forces, though both are developing nuclear triads capable of delivering warheads by land, air and sea, according to Christopher Clary, a security affairs expert at the University at Albany in the US.\"India likely has a larger air leg (aircraft capable of delivering nuclear weapons) than Pakistan. While we know the least of Pakistan's naval leg, it is reasonable to assess that India's naval leg is more advanced and more capable than Pakistan's sea-based nuclear force,\" he told the BBC.One reason, Mr Clary said, is that Pakistan has invested nowhere near the \"time or money\" that India has in building a nuclear-powered submarine, giving India a \"clear qualitative\" edge in naval nuclear capability.Since testing nuclear weapons in 1998, Pakistan has never formally declared an official nuclear doctrine.India, by contrast, adopted a no-first-use policy following its own 1998 tests. But this stance has shown signs of softening. In 2003, India reserved theright to use nuclear weaponsin response to chemical or biological attacks - effectively allowing for first use under certain conditions.Further ambiguity emerged in 2016, when thenâdefence minister Manohar Parrikar suggestedIndia shouldn't feel \"bound\" by the policy, raising questions about its long-term credibility. (Parrikar clarified that this was his own opinion.)\nThe absence of a formal doctrine doesn't mean Pakistan lacks one - official statements, interviews and nuclear developmentsoffer clear cluesto its operational posture, according to Sadia Tasleem of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.Pakistan's nuclear threshold remains vague, but in 2001, Khalid Kidwai - then head of the Strategic Plans Division of the NCA - outlined four red lines: major territorial loss, destruction of key military assets, economic strangulation or political destabilisation.In 2002, then-president Pervez Musharraf clarified that \"nuclear weapons are aimed solely at India\", and would only be used if \"the very existence of Pakistan as a state\" was at stake.In his memoir, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote that he was jolted awake at night to speak with an unnamed \"Indian counterpart\" whofeared Pakistan was preparing to use nuclear weaponsduring the 2019 stand-off with India.Around the same time,Pakistani media quoted a senior officialissuing a stark warning to India: \"I hope you know what the [National Command Authority] means and what it constitutes. I said that we will surprise you. Wait for that surpriseâ¦ You have chosen a path of war without knowing the consequences for the peace and security of the region.\"During the 1999 Kargil War, Pakistan's then-foreign secretary Shamshad Ahmed warned that the country would not\"hesitate to use any weapon\"to defend its territory. Years later, US official Bruce Riedel revealed that intelligence indicated Pakistan was preparing its nuclear arsenal forpossible deployment.\nBut there is scepticism on both sides over such claims.Former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria wrote in his memoir that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict in 2019. And during Kargil, Pakistan \"knew the Indian Air Force wouldn't cross into its territory\" - so there was no real trigger for even an implicit nuclear threat, insist Pakistani analysts.\"Strategic signalling reminds the world that any conflict can spiral - and with India and Pakistan, the stakes are higher due to the nuclear overhang. But that doesn't mean either side is actively threatening nuclear use,\" Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC.But nuclear escalation can happen by accident too. \"This could happen by human error, hackers, terrorists, computer failures, bad data from satellites and unstable leaders,\" Prof Alan Robock of Rutgers University, lead author of the landmark 2019 paper by a global team of scientists, told the BBC.In March 2022, Indiaaccidentally fired a nuclear-capable cruise missilewhich travelled 124km (77 miles) into Pakistani territory before crashing, reportedly damaging civilian property. Pakistan said India failed to use the military hotline or issue a public statement for two days. Had this occurred during heightened tensions, the incident could have spiralled into serious conflict, experts say. (Months later, India's governmentsacked three air force officersfor the \"accidental firing of a missile\".)Yet, the danger of nuclear war remains \"relatively small\" between India and Pakistan, according to Mr Clary.\"So long as there is not major ground combat along the border, the dangers of nuclear use remain relatively small and manageable,\" he said.\"In ground combat, the 'use it or lose it' problem is propelled by the possibility that your ground positions will be overrun by the enemy.\" ('Use it or lose it' refers to the pressure a nuclear-armed country may feel to launch its weapons before they are destroyed in a first strike by an adversary.)\nSumit Ganguly, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, believes that \"neither India nor Pakistan wants to be labelled as the first violator of the post-Hiroshima nuclear taboo\".\"Furthermore, any side that resorts to the use of nuclear weapons would face substantial retaliation and suffer unacceptable casualties,\" Mr Ganguly told the BBC.At the same time, both India and Pakistan appear to be beefing up their nuclear arsenal.With new delivery systems in development, four plutonium reactors and expanding uranium enrichment, Pakistan's nuclear arsenal could reach around 200 warheads by the late 2020s, according toThe Nuclear Notebook, researched by the Federation of American Scientists' Nuclear Information Project.And as of early 2023, India was estimated to have about 680kg of weapons-grade plutonium - enough forroughly 130-210 nuclear warheads, according to the International Panel on Fissile Materials.Despite repeated crises and close calls, both sides have so far managed to avoid a catastrophic slide into nuclear conflict. \"The deterrent is still holding. All Pakistanis did was to respond to conventional strikes with counter-conventional strikes of their own,\"writesUmer Farooq, an Islamabad-based analyst.Yet, the presence of nuclear weapons injects a constant undercurrent of risk - one that can never be entirely ruled out, no matter how experienced the leadership or how restrained the intentions.\"When nuclear weapons can be involved, there is always an unacceptable level of danger,\"John Erath, senior policy director at the non-profit Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, told the BBC.\"The Indian and Pakistani governments have navigated these situations in the past, so the risk is small.  But with nuclear weapons, even a small risk is too large.\""

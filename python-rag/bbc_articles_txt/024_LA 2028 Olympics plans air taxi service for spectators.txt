LA 2028 Olympics plans air taxi service for spectators

Spectators could fly through the Los Angeles skies and escape the city's notorious traffic during the 2028 Olympic Games if the organisers have their way.LA28, the committee charged with planning the city's third Summer Games, have announced a partnership with Archer Aviation to provide an air taxi service during both the Olympic and Paralympic Games.The company says it plans to use a fleet of aircraft to ferry fans to and from venues, LA28 announced on Thursday.Flying taxis have been a longstanding dream. They were planned to debut in the Paris Games in 2024, but were not certified by Europe's air safety agency in time.
Similarly, Archer Aviation has not yet been certified by the US Federal Aviation Administration, meaning the aircraft are not ready yet for commercial use. It's founder and CEO has said he hoped to have that key signoff - a Type Certification that says it meets design and safety standards - by the aviation regulator this year.If they receive certification in time for the 2028 Games, the air taxis would offer 10-20 minute flights to residents and visitors and fly between select destinations, including several of the largest Olympic venues in the region.It is unclear how much each trip would cost, but Archer Aviation's founder and CEO Adam Goldstein said he wants to keep prices comparable to a high-end Uber, according to the Los Angeles Times.Like the popular ride-hailing service, customers would be able to request an air taxi through an app. The aircraft can carry up to four people and operates similarly to a helicopter in its take-offs and landings.The Hollywood Olympics: All you need to know about Los Angeles 2028Olympic flag arrives in Los AngelesThe piloted Midnight aircraft is part of a family of vehicles called "eVTOLs" - which stands for electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft.Archer is among several eVTOL makers seeking to change travel in congested urban cities by offering short-haul air travel.The industry has seen many hurdles, including battery density, and none of the aircraft have yet been approved by the FAA.Archer's Midnight aircraft is built with 12 engines and propellers, and produces "less noise and emissions than a traditional helicopter", according to LA28.Archer Aviation hopes it will be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) "at similar levels of safety as commercial airliners"."We want to transform the way people get around Los Angeles and leave a legacy that shapes the future of transportation in America," Mr Goldstein said in a statement. "There's no better time to do that than during the LA28 Games."Safety, regulations and investment have proved a big hurdle for companies trying to introduce flying taxis. Despite the setbacks and delays, many still believe they could be the future of transportation.Archer Aviation remains confident its aircraft can buck recent trends, and sees the 2028 Olympics as a way to introduce them to the world.The UK government announced the Future of Flight action plan in 2024, predicting that the first flying taxi could take off in the UK by 2026 and become a regular sight in the skies.Los Angeles has previously hosted the Olympics in 1984 and 1932, making this the third time the city has hosted the Summer Games. The city has announced the 2028 Games will not allow cars, a tall order after plans were nixed to expand the area's transit system.

Mexico accuses MrBeast of exploiting Mayan pyramids

Mexico is seeking compensation from the producers of a MrBeast video and accused the US YouYuber of exploiting its ancient pyramids for commercial gain.The video "I Explored 2000 Year Old Ancient Temples" shows the influencer, real name Jimmy Donaldson, 27, and his team exploring ancient Mayan cities, with a permit.But in one part of the video produced by Full Circle Media, which has received more than 60 million views in a  week, MrBeast advertises a  chocolate product as a "Mayan dessert" and urges viewers to buy it.Authorities said that while they had granted permission to film at the sites, they had not permitted for-profit use. A MrBeast representative denied some of the accusations.
The spokesperson told the BBC: "No advertisement material was shot on any archaeological sites overseen by INAH (National Institute of Anthropology and History)."In the video, the scene promoting the chocolate snack appears to be filmed at the influencer's camping site.The spokesperson also said the video was "meant to highlight these treasured Mayan sites in Mexico" and that it was "unfortunate that this has turned into a political issue - hopefully it can lead to a productive dialogue and encourages people to visit these unique historical treasures".Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum on Wednesday called for an investigation into the conditions under which the filming permit had been granted.In the video's caption, MrBeast thanks Mexican tourism and government authorities for permission to film in the sites, while also plugging links to his chocolate product.The video shows him and his team exploring areas of restricted access in the Mayan cities of Calakmul and Chichén Itzá. At one point he says "I can't believe the government's letting us do this."They are also shown appearing to descend into a pyramid from a helicopter and in another scene are shown handling an ancient pre-Hispanic mask.But heritage authorities said these were "false assertions" and accused the YouTuber of presenting misinformation. INAH said MrBeast had never held a real pre-Hispanic mask and there appeared to have been extensive post-production editing in the video - such as the helicopter scene."All of these are false assertions that obey the theatricality of the YouTuber in question," its statement on Monday read.Mexico's Secretary of Culture Claudia Curiel de Icaza said on Thursday that, although they had authorised the permit for MrBeast to film, they had never authorised the publication of false information or the use of heritage site images for trademark advertising."We disapprove of any commercial pursuit that distorts the value of archaeological sites, which are a legacy of our indigenous cultures and the pride of our nation," she said.She added that, although Mexico was open to content that contributes to the "knowledge and dissemination of Mexico's archaeological and cultural heritage" it was firmly against those who "take advantage of the willingness of institutions".She said INAH would consider "administrative sanctions" against Full Circle Media, who was issued the permit to film. The BBC has sought comment from the firm.MrBeast, dubbed the King of YouTube, is the most-subscribed to person on the platform, with 395 million followers. His Mayan pyramids video was published on 10 May.
